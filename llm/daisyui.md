[](#1-core-improvement)1\. Core Improvement
-------------------------------------------

> TLDR – daisyUI 5 is compatible with Tailwind CSS 4, has zero dependencies, a smaller package size, smaller CSS size, and is more customizable. CSS variables are now more readable and more flexible.  
> [Skip to the next section](#2-build-and-integration-improvements)

### [](#tailwind-css-4-compatibility)Tailwind CSS 4 compatibility

Tailwind CSS 4 is crazy good! A lot of new features and improvements are added and also many changes to the plugin API.

daisyUI 5 works with Tailwind CSS 4 and takes advantage of all the new features.

With Tailwind CSS 4, you can now import daisyUI as a plugin in the CSS file.

Before

    // tailwind.config.{js,ts,mjs,cjs}
    module.exports = {
      content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
      plugins: [
        require('daisyui');
      ],
    }

After

    /* app.css */
    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui";
    
    
    
    
    

See[Tailwind CSS upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide)for more information.

### [](#zero-dependencies)Zero dependencies

Reducing the number of dependencies in your project is important for many reasons. It leads to faster build times and better performance in your workflow. Fewer dependencies also make your app more secure by reducing the chance of potential for vulnerabilities from less maintained packages. Also, managing a smaller dependency tree makes maintenance easier and reduces the chance of deprecation problems or version conflict in the long term.

Last year I reduced the number of dependencies in daisyUI, from ~100 (dependencies + sub dependencies in total) to 7!

This time we got rid of all the remaining ones!  
daisyUI 5 has no dependencies. Hopefully this helps to clean up your node\_modules a little bit.

Before

    Dependencies - Total 1.8 MB on disk (250 files)
      ├╴ culori
      ├╴ picocolors
      ├╴ postcss-js
      │  ╰╴ camelcase-css
      ╰╴ css-selector-tokenizer
         ├╴ cssesc
         ╰╴ fastparse

After

    No dependencies - 0 kB
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

### [](#smaller-size)Smaller size

With daisyUI as a Tailwind CSS plugin, only the needed styles are included in the final CSS file. Other than that we have made a lot of optimizations to make both package size and CSS file size smaller.

daisyUI 5 NPM package is 61% smaller in size.

Before

Install size – 4.7 MB  

After

Install size – 1.8 MB  

daisyUI 5 CDN file, including all possible class names, is 75% smaller in size

Before

full.css – 137 kB compressed  

After

daisyui.css – 34 kB compressed  

It is now safe and efficient to use the CDN file in production. The compressed CSS file, is now 34 kB only thanks to native CSS nesting and huge amount of optimizations in daisyUI 5. This is the smallest size ever for the daisyUI CDN file, including all the possible daisyUI components and colors, available for all Tailwind CSS responsive prefixes. This is a CSS file, minified, compressed and cached on CDN.

### [](#improved-color-variables)Improved color variables

With Tailwind CSS 3 and daisyUI 4, we had to extract the color values of each color into CSS variables, and pass it to Tailwind CSS alongside a special`<alpha-value>`variable so Tailwind CSS could generate opacity variables for each color utility class.

Tailwind CSS 4 doesn't have this limitation because it uses CSS`color-mix()`to control the opacity.

With daisyUI 5 we can finally put the whole color inside CSS variables. All color formats are supported, no transformation is needed no JS object is needed.

We also updated the variable names to be more readable in the output CSS, which means you can even customize the color values using the browser dev tools color picker.

Before

    /* hard to read variable names, hard to customize values */
    {
    --b1: 100% 0 0;

[](#2-build-and-integration-improvements)2\. Build and integration improvements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> TLDR – Import only the parts you need.  
> Micro CSS files are now available for no-build projects.  
> Native CSS nesting reduces CSS size.  
> It's ESM compatible and has dependency-free class name prefixing.  
> [Skip to the next section](#3-design-system-improvements)

### [](#native-css-nesting)Native CSS nesting

CSS nesting is now supported on all browsers. daisyUI 5 uses CSS nesting which prevents duplication of CSS rules and results smaller CSS size in your browser!

### [](#esm-compatibility)ESM compatibility

daisyUI 5 is now ESM (ECMAScript Module) compatible. Which means you can import and use specific parts of the library in JS if you need to.

### [](#dependency-free-class-name-prefixing)Dependency-free class name prefixing

daisyUI 5 can now prefix class names without a dependency.

### [](#micro-css-files-for-no-build-projects)Micro CSS files for No-Build projects

For server-side rendered projects (Rails, Django, PHP, etc) or projects that don't have a JS build step (HTMX, Alpine.js, WordPress, etc), it's now possible to use specific parts of daisyUI without including the entire library or even without Tailwind CSS.

For example if you only want to use daisyUI toggle component, include a tiny CSS file that only contains the styles for the toggle component:

Before

    Not possible

After

    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/components/toggle.css

All components, all themes, and basically every single part of daisyUI library[is now available as compressed. minified CSS files on CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/chunks.css).

Also, with the 75% smaller daisyui.css (formerly full.css) CDN file, it is now safe and efficient to use the CDN file in production. The compressed CSS file, is now 34 kB only thanks to native CSS nesting and huge amount of optimizations in daisyUI 5.

Check out the[CDN docs](/docs/cdn/)to customize the parts of the library you want to include in your project from the CDN.

### [](#include-and-exclude-parts-of-the-library)Include and Exclude parts of the library

Now for the first time, it's possible to include/exclude specific parts of daisyUI library. For example if you only want to use the "Toggle" component, you can include only the "Toggle" component and exclude everything else!

Before

    Not possible
    
    
    

After

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      include: toggle;
    }

Or if you want to exclude a specific part of the library, you can do that too!

Before

    Not possible
    
    
    

After

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      exclude: scrollbar;
    }

[](#3-design-system-improvements)3\. Design System Improvements
---------------------------------------------------------------

> TLDR – New "Effect" CSS variables.  
> Size improvements + new`xl`size modifier.  
> New component style modifiers:`*-soft`and`*-dash`.  
> Color format flexibility.  
> [Skip to the next section](#4-themes-and-styling)

### [](#new-effect-css-variables)New "Effect" CSS variables

daisyUI 5 introduces a new set of effects that can be enabled or disabled globally or per theme. These effects change the look and feel of relevant components, like buttons, checkbox, toggle, etc.

Currently, the following effects are available:

*   `--depth`: adds a clean, subtle depth effect to the components, making them look more visually appealing
*   `--noise`: adds a slight noise effect to the components, giving them a more textured look

These effects can be enabled or disabled using a CSS variable. Check out the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page to see how it works.

### [](#new-x-large-size)New "X-Large" size

All components that previously had`xs`,`sm`,`md`, and`lg`size modifiers now also support a new`xl`size modifier. This gives you more control over the size of components and allows you to create more flexible and responsive designs.

### [](#size-scale-improvements)Size scale improvements

With the addition of the new`xl`size modifier, the size scale of components has been adjusted to make it consistent. The new size scale is more harmonious and visually appealing.

In daisyUI 4, the size difference between sizes was not following a consistent scale.  
The new default size scale is consistent and more visually appealing ...and it's customizable!

Button height scale

Before

After

`xs`

6 × 4 = 24px

6× 4 = 24px

`sm`

8 × 4 = 32px

8× 4 = 32px

`md`

12× 4 = 48px

10× 4 = 40px

`lg`

16× 4 = 64px

12× 4 = 48px

`xl`

\-

14× 4 = 56px

Checkbox height scale

Before

After

`xs`

4 × 4 = 16px

4× 4 = 16px

`sm`

5 × 4 = 20px

5× 4 = 20px

`md`

6 × 4 = 24px

6× 4 = 24px

`lg`

8× 4 = 32px

7× 4 = 28px

`xl`

\-

8× 4 = 32px

### [](#size-scale-customization)Size scale customization

Component size scales are now customizable. Previously, customizing the size of components required a lot of manual work.  
Now everything is tokenized with CSS variables, You can define the size scale of the components globally or per theme, making them shorter or taller, based on your design needs.

*   `--size-field`variable is used to define the base size of fields like input, button, tab, etc.
*   `--size-selector`variable is used to define the base size of selectors like checkbox, radio, toggle, badge, etc.

See how it works in the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page.

### [](#border-size-customization)Border size customization

Border size of buttons, inputs, tab, et are now customizable globally or per theme.

*   `--border`variable is used to define the border size of components like button, input, tab, etc.

See how it works in the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page.

### [](#new-component-styles-soft-and-dash)New component styles: "soft" and "dash"

Components like`button`,`badge`,`alert`now have`soft`and`dash`styles.  
`soft`style makes the component look softer and`dash`style adds a dashed border to the component.

### [](#all-modifier-classes-are-now-responsive)All modifier classes are now responsive

daisyUI 5 makes all modifiers responsive by default. This means you can use responsive modifiers like`md:`,`lg:`, etc. with all component modifier classes, not just a selected few.

### [](#color-format-flexibility)Color format flexibility

daisyUI 5 supports all color formats and doesn't convert your colors to a specific format.

Before Tailwind CSS 4, color values of utility classes had to be generated at build time so the only way to have CSS variables for colors and being able to use Tailwind CSS opacity modifiers was to use a specific color format and pass it tailwind to generate the opacity variables.  
Tailwind CSS 4 now uses CSS variables for colors and`color-mix()`to control the opacity. This means we can use any color format we want and no transformation is needed.  
daisyUI built-in themes still use OKLCH color format and I would recommend using OKLCH for custom themes too, but you can use any color format you want and neither daisyUI nor Tailwind CSS will convert it to another format at build time.

[](#4-themes-and-styling)4\. Themes and styling
-----------------------------------------------

Themes and colors are what makes your website unique. We've made significant improvements to the themes and colors in daisyUI 5, including new themes, improved existing themes, and a new Theme Generator to help you create your own custom themes.

> TLDR – New themes + improved existing themes.  
> New Theme Generator to create custom themes.

*   `caramellatte`– Warm, cozy, light theme featuring brown and beige
*   `abyss`– Deep dark green, teal and phosphorus color palette
*   `silk`– Bright, clean and bold theme with fluorescent text colors

### [](#existing-themes-improvements)Existing themes improvements

Most daisyUI themes have been adjusted to look better and consistent. color contrast and accessibility got even better and the colors are more harmonious. These changes make the color more visually appealing and easier to read.

### [](#all-new-theme-generator)All-new Theme Generator

Check out the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page to create your own custom theme. Create, customize or extend themes, or generate stunning new themes using the new daisyUI color palette generator algorithm.

> TLDR – Automatic`*-content`color calculation is removed. Theme variable names have changed for better consistency and readability. Previous themes are available for easy migration.  
> [Skip to the next section](#14-bug-fixes)

Automatic`*-content`color calculation based on background color was removed. Now that Tailwind CSS supports CSS variables for colors, we no longer process and convert color values at build time. You can use any color format you want and neither daisyUI nor Tailwind CSS will convert it to another format at build time.

Most themes have been adjusted to look better and consistent. color contrast and accessibility got even better and the colors are more harmonious. These changes make the color more visually appealing and easier to read.  
If you prefer using the previous colors, I[prepared a repo, including all daisyUI 4 theme colors](https://github.com/daisyui/v4-themes-for-v5/)easy to copy/paste in daisyUI 5.

All color variable names have been changed to be aligned with new Tailwind CSS 4 syntax. And to be more readable and easier to customize[See the new color format](#improved-color-variables)

[](#14-bug-fixes)14\. Bug fixes
-------------------------------

> TLDR – More than 95% of all the open issues from daisyUI 4 have been fixed in this release.  
> [Skip to the next section](#15-get-started-with-daisyui-5)

Some of these bugs were fixed automatically by the new changes in changes in the core library, design system, themes, and components. Some of them became possible with the new capabilities of Tailwind CSS 4.

And some of these bugs were related to a specific structure / style / behavior of components and changing them in a patch release would have caused breaking changes for all existing projects. We had to wait for the major release to apply these changes.

If you've been waiting for a specific bug fix, here are the bugs that have been fixed in this release. Let me know if I miss any bug or let me know if a bug is closed by mistake 💚

[](#500)5.0.0
-------------

> This is the detailed list of changes per component. Most of these changes won't affect your project, so if you want to learn about the breaking changes only, [check out the daisyUI 5 release notes](/docs/v5/)

### [](#alert)Alert

🆕 Additions

*   Added `alert-outline`, `alert-dash`, and `alert-soft` variants.
*   Added `alert-vertical` and `alert-horizontal` layout options.

🔧 Changes

*   Instead of hardcoded responsive breakpoints, you can now use the `max-sm:alert-horizontal` or any other responsive breakpoint.

### [](#artboard)Artboard

🗑️ Removals

*   **Breaking Change:** Removed all `artboard` and `phone-*` classes. These classes were simply setting the width and height of the div. Use Tailwind CSS `w-*` and `h-*` classes instead.

Before

After

`artboard phone-1`

`w-[320px] h-[568px]`

`artboard phone-2`

`w-[375px] h-[667px]`

`artboard phone-3`

`w-[414px] h-[736px]`

`artboard phone-4`

`w-[375px] h-[812px]`

`artboard phone-5`

`w-[414px] h-[896px]`

`artboard phone-6`

`w-[320px] h-[1024px]`

Before

After

`artboard artboard-horizontal phone-1`

`w-[568px] h-[320px]`

`artboard artboard-horizontal phone-2`

`w-[667px] h-[375px]`

`artboard artboard-horizontal phone-3`

`w-[736px] h-[414px]`

`artboard artboard-horizontal phone-4`

`w-[812px] h-[375px]`

`artboard artboard-horizontal phone-5`

`w-[896px] h-[414px]`

`artboard artboard-horizontal phone-6`

`w-[1024px] h-[320px]`

page.html

    - <div class="artboard phone-1">
    + <div class="w-[320px] h-[568px]">

To be clear, `mockup-phone` is not removed. It just doesn't need the `artboard` class anymore.

### [](#avatar)Avatar

🔧 Changes

*   **Breaking Change:** Renamed `online` class to `avatar-online`, `offline` to `avatar-offline`, and `placeholder` to `avatar-placeholder`.

page.html

    - <div class="avatar online">
    + <div class="avatar avatar-online">
      <div class="w-24 rounded-full">
        <img src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/stock/photo-1534528741775-53994a69daeb.webp" />
      </div>
    </div>

page.html

    - <div class="avatar offline">
    + <div class="avatar avatar-offline">
      <div class="w-24 rounded-full">
        <img src="https://img.daisyui.com/images/stock/photo-1534528741775-53994a69daeb.webp" />
      </div>
    </div>

### [](#badge)Badge

🆕 Additions

*   Added `badge-dash`, and `badge-soft` styles.
*   Added `badge-xl` size.
*   Added a default `gap-2` between content of badge so you don't have to add it manually to put a space between the text and icon.

🔧 Changes

*   Adjusted sizes based on the new scale.

### [](#breadcrumbs)Breadcrumbs

🆕 Additions

*   Added a default `gap-2` for the element inside list item so you don't have to add it manually to put a space between the text and icon.

### [](#bottom-navigation)Bottom Navigation

### [](#other-removals)Other removals

#### [](#-remove-form-control-label-text-label-text-alt)🗑️ Remove form-control, label-text, label-text-alt

You can still use the same HTML still, but class names don't exist anymore and won't apply color, font-size, flex, etc.  
I suggest using the newly added class names for `fieldset` and `legend` elements for better accessibility.

before

    <label class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
      Login
      <div class="label">

    </label>

after

    <fieldset class="fieldset">
      <legend>Login</legend>
      <label class="label" for="name">Name</label>
      <input id="name" class="input" placeholder="Name" />
    </fieldset>

before

    <label class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
      <div class="label">
        <span class="label-text">What is your name?</span>
        <span class="label-text-alt">Top Right label</span>
      </div>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Type here" class="input input-bordered w-full max-w-xs" />

        <span class="label-text-alt">Bottom Left label</span>
        <span class="label-text-alt">Bottom Right label</span>

      <label class="label flex justify-between" for="name">

        <span>Top Right label</span>
      </label>
      <input id="name" class="input" placeholder="Name" />
      <label class="label flex justify-between" for="name">
        <span>Bottom Left label</span>
        <span>Bottom Right label</span>
      </label>
    </fieldset>

#### [](#-remove-btn-group-and-input-group)🗑️ Remove btn-group and input-group

btn-group, input-group were deprecated a year ago and now finally removed.  
If you've been using btn-group or input-group, you can use `join` instead

before

    <div class="btn-group">
      <button class="btn">Button 1</button>
      <button class="btn">Button 2</button>
    </div>

after

    <div class="join">

Introduction
============

What is daisyUI and why should you use it?

[](#what-is-daisyui)What is daisyUI?
------------------------------------

daisyUI is a collection of CSS class names. These class names are a high-level abstraction of Tailwind CSS utility classes.  
Imagine you use Tailwind CSS with superpowers!

[](#how-does-daisyui-work)How does daisyUI work?
------------------------------------------------

daisyUI is a NPM package, you can install it as a dev dependency in your project.  
Then you add it to Tailwind CSS as a plugin. This makes all the daisyUI class names available to Tailwind CSS and you can use them like any other Tailwind CSS class names.

daisyUI uses the Tailwind CSS plugin API to extend the available Tailwind CSS class names. This means that daisyUI is fully compatible with Tailwind CSS and you can use it with any Tailwind CSS project.

[](#why-should-i-use-daisyui)Why should I use daisyUI?
------------------------------------------------------

**daisyUI is for you if you:**

*   Are tired of writing thousands of utility class names repeatedly
*   Want more readable and maintainable code
*   Need to design interfaces faster with less code
*   Want a consistent design system across projects
*   Want to use standard UI parts, without making design decisions for every single detail
*   Want dark mode and many other themes available out of the box
*   Want to use a design system that is based on real-world UI design principles
*   Want development speed and customization at the same time

**daisyUI is not for you if you:**

*   Want to waste time re-inventing all the standard UI parts like buttons, cards, checkboxes, etc, for each project.
*   Want to swim in the ocean of thousands of class names and never find your way out.
*   Want to make your codebase a mess and spend hours figuring out what part of the code is responsible for what part of the UI.
*   Want to waste your time and money re-inventing the wheel instead of shipping your actual project.

[](#whats-the-difference-between-daisyui-and-tailwind-css)What's the difference between daisyUI and Tailwind CSS?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes, which usually include only one CSS rule.  
daisyUI classes are a combination of multiple CSS rule that are named semantically for each part of the UI.

For example Tailwind CSS class names decide if padding should be 4px or 8px. daisyUI class names decide if a HTML element should look like a`card`, a`button`, a`toggle`, etc, just like what we would call them semantically in a design system.

This makes it easier to design interfaces with less code and more consistency. For example if you want to make a card using Tailwind CSS you would have to write one or multiple utility class names for each single CSS rule. Doing this over and over again for each element, for each page, for each project is time consuming and hard to manage. It also makes it harder to maintain your code as you have to always figure out what part of the code is responsible for what part of the UI.

daisyUI solves this problem by providing higher level class names that are named based on the UI parts. For example to make a card, we simply use the`card`class name and daisyUI gives you all the necessary CSS rules to make a card. Then if you need additional customization, you can add Tailwind CSS utility classes to the element to make it look the way you want.

daisyUI is not a replacement for Tailwind CSS, it's a plugin that makes Tailwind CSS more powerful and easier to use.

[](#is-daisyui-aligned-with-tailwind-css-utility-first-philosophy)Is daisyUI aligned with Tailwind CSS' utility-first philosophy?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! It's utility-first, not utility-only.

daisyUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS's component API. Tailwind CSS as a library provides utility classes and suggests using utility classes for maximum flexibility and customization. However that's means slower development and more code to write.  
That's why many people find it hard to use Tailwind CSS for designing interfaces. It takes a professional designer to make design decisions for many details of the UI to make them look good. It also takes a lot of time to write all the utility class names for each part of the UI. Even copying and pasting those huge chunks of utility class names is not helpful, as it makes the codebase hard to read and maintain.

Imagine one side of the spectrum is maximum customization and flexibility and you should make design decisions for every single detail. On the other side of the spectrum is maximum development speed and less code to write, but you have no control over the design. daisyUI and Tailwind CSS together give you the best of both worlds.  
Use daisyUI class names to write less code and develop faster, and use Tailwind CSS utility classes to customize the design when you need to.

Is it full circle?  
If you've been using Bootstrap many years ago, you may think it doesn't make sense to go back to using components.

But here's the catch: The problem with Bootstrap was not class names! Bootstrap class names were actually really fast to work with. The problem was lack of customization and flexibility. At some point every Bootstrap website looked the same unless you open a CSS file and write tons of custom CSS.  
Tailwind CSS solves this problem of customization and flexibility but the cost is slower development and more code to write! You wanted customization and flexibility? Good luck making design decisions for every single pixel in your page! Not a practical approach, right?

We need customization development speed at the same time. daisyUI is here to make this possible.

[](#how-does-daisyui-fit-in-atomic-design-principles)How does daisyUI fit in Atomic Design principles?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Atomic Design is a methodology for creating design systems. It breaks down the UI into smaller parts, like atoms, molecules, organisms, etc.

You can think of Tailwind CSS utility classes as atoms. They are the smallest parts of the UI that you can use to build larger parts. daisyUI classes are like molecules and organisms. They are higher-level abstractions of the UI parts that are made of atoms.

Larger parts of the UI, like templates and pages are quickly possible by putting these molecules and organisms together in layouts, using grid or flexbox, and adding functionality and content to them.

[](#is-daisyui-free)Is daisyUI free?
------------------------------------

Yes, daisyUI is free and open-source, under the MIT license. You can use it in any project, commercial or non-commercial, without any restrictions.

Why is it free? daisyUI's goal is to improve the web development experience for everyone. I believe web development is already complex enough with all the different technologies, frameworks and tools. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn and master all these tools. daisyUI is here to make the design part of web development easier and faster, so you can focus on the actual product you are building.

[](#how-can-i-support-daisyui)How can I support daisyUI?
--------------------------------------------------------

You can support daisyUI by using it in your projects, sharing it with your friends and colleagues, and contributing to the project on GitHub. You can also support daisyUI by becoming a sponsor on GitHub or Open Collective.

[](#can-i-use-daisyui-without-tailwind-css)Can I use daisyUI without Tailwind CSS?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, daisyUI can be used standalone without Tailwind CSS. However, it's recommended to use daisyUI with Tailwind CSS. Here's why:  
daisyUI provides pieces of UI you can use to make a website. Like Button, Toggle, Card, etc. You need something to glue these pieces together! For example you need flex box, grid, padding, margin, etc. Tailwind CSS provides these low-level utility classes that you can use to glue the UI pieces together. So daisyUI and Tailwind CSS are a perfect match. You can use daisyUI to design the UI parts and Tailwind CSS for layout, spacing, font-size and other low-level CSS rules.

Alternatively if you don't want to use Tailwind CSS, you can use daisyUI for components and write your own styles for layout, spacing, etc.

[](#can-i-use-daisyui-with-other-ui-frameworks)Can I use daisyUI with other UI frameworks?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can mix and match daisyUI with any UI framework that add styles based on class names. If there's any class name conflict, you can use prefix to avoid conflicts between two libraries.

[](#which-frameworks-can-i-use-daisyui-with)Which frameworks can I use daisyUI with?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALL of them! daisyUI is framework agnostic. You can use it anywhere you can use CSS.

Add component classes to your HTML
==================================

How to use daisyUI classes to style your page?

Once you [installed daisyUI](/docs/install/), you can use component classes like `btn`, `card`, etc.

So instead of making a button using only utility classes

    <button
      class="inline-block cursor-pointer rounded-md bg-gray-800 px-4 py-3 text-center text-sm font-semibold uppercase text-white transition duration-200 ease-in-out hover:bg-gray-900">
      Button
    </button>

Button

You can just use a component class like this

    <button class="btn">Button</button>

Button

Then you can modify the component with daisyUI additional utility classes

    <button class="btn btn-primary">Button</button>

Button

Or you can modify the component with Tailwind CSS utility classes

    <button class="btn w-64 rounded-full">Button</button>

Button

daisyUI 5 upgrade guide
=======================

This guide helps you how to update your project to Tailwind CSS 4 and daisyUI 5.

> Before upgrading your project, read about:  
> 1 -[Tailwind CSS 4 breaking changes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#changes-from-v3)  
> 2 -[daisyUI 5 release notes](/docs/v5/)  
> 3 -[daisyUI 5 breaking changes](/docs/upgrade#changes-from-v4)

### [](#1-update-tailwind-css)1\. Update Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS provides a CLI tool for automatic upgrade. It automatically applies the new Tailwind CSS changes to your project.

1.  First, remove daisyUI and plugins from your`tailwind.config.js`file, so Tailwind CSS upgrade tool can safely replace it with the CSS file.

tailwind.config.js

    module.exports = {
       content: ['./your-files/**/*.{html,js}'],
       // other stuff...
    -  daisyui: {
    -    themes: ['light', 'dark', 'cupcake'],
    -  },
    - plugins: [require("daisyui")],
    }

2.  Run the[official Tailwind CSS upgrade tool](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide):

Terminal

    npx @tailwindcss/upgrade

### [](#2-update-daisyui)2\. Update daisyUI

1.  Install daisyUI 5

Terminal

    npm i -D daisyui@latest

3.  Add daisyUI to your CSS file

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui";

OR if you want[enable a built-in theme](/docs/themes/#enable-a-built-in-theme)in[config](/docs/config/):

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark, cupcake;
    }

Now everything should work as expected. If you're facing any challenges, you can ask for help on[daisyUI Discord server](/discord/)so you can get help from the community.

* * *

[](#changes-from-v4)Changes from v4
-----------------------------------

These are all the HTML changes from daisyUI 4 to 5. There are ~15 changes in total but you won't need to do all of them, only the ones you're using.

*   To read about new features in daisyUI 5 go to[release notes page](/docs/v5/)
*   For more detailed changelog go to[changelogs page](/docs/changelog/)

### [](#artboard)Artboard

*   Rename`camera`class in mockup-phone to`mockup-phone-camera`.
*   Rename`display`class in mockup-phone to`mockup-phone-display`.
*   `mockup-phone-display`

    +    <div class="w-[320px] h-[568px]">Hi.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

### [](#select)Select

*   Select now has a default width of 20rem, no need for adding`w-full max-w-xs`.`max-w-none`class.
    
*   Removed`select-border`. Select has a border by default now. Use`select-ghost`if you want to remove the border.
    

before

    <!-- Select with border -->
    <select class="select select-bordered">
    
    <!-- Select without border -->
    <select class="select">
    
    <!-- Select with consistent width -->
    <select class="select w-full max-w-xs">

    <!-- Select without border -->
    <select class="select select-ghost">
    
    <!-- Select with consistent width -->
    <select class="select">

### [](#stack)Stack

*   Instead of setting the width and height of the stack items, use width and height for the stack itself.

page.html

    - <div class="stack">
    -   <div class="card bg-base-100 w-36 h-36">Text</div>
    -   <div class="card bg-base-100 w-36 h-36">Text</div>

    +   <div class="card bg-base-100">Text</div>
    +   <div class="card bg-base-100">Text</div>
    </div>

### [](#stat)Stat

*   `stats`background color is now transparent. Use`bg-base-100`if you need a background color.

### [](#tab)Tab

*   Renamed`tabs-bordered`to`tabs-border`.

page.html

    - <div class="tabs tabs-bordered">
    + <div class="tabs tabs-border">

*   Renamed`tabs-lifted`to`tabs-lift`.

page.html

    - <div class="tabs tabs-lifted">
    + <div class="tabs tabs-lift">

*   Renamed`tabs-boxed`to`tabs-box`.

page.html

    - <div class="tabs tabs-boxed">
    + <div class="tabs tabs-box">

### [](#table)Table

*   Removed`hover`class. Use`hover:bg-base-300`(or any other color) instead.

page.html

    - <tr class="hover">
    + <tr class="hover:bg-base-300">

### [](#textarea)Textarea

*   Removed`textarea-border`. Textarea has a border by default now. Use`textarea-ghost`if you want to remove the border.

### [](#other-removals)Other removals

*   Remove form-control, label-text, label-text-alt

You can still use the same HTML still, but class names don't exist anymore and won't apply color, font-size, flex, etc.  
I suggest using the newly added class names for`fieldset`and`legend`elements for better accessibility.

before

    <label class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
      Login
      <div class="label">
        <span class="label-text">Name</span>
      </div>
      <input class="input" placeholder="Name" />
    </label>

after

    <fieldset class="fieldset">
      <legend>Login</legend>
      <label class="label" for="name">Name</label>
      <input id="name" class="input" placeholder="Name" />
    </fieldset>

before

    <label class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
      <div class="label">
        <span class="label-text">What is your name?</span>
        <span class="label-text-alt">Top Right label</span>
      </div>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Type here" class="input input-bordered w-full max-w-xs" />
      <div class="label">
        <span class="label-text-alt">Bottom Left label</span>
        <span class="label-text-alt">Bottom Right label</span>
      </div>
    </label>

after

    <fieldset class="fieldset max-w-xs">
      <label class="label flex justify-between" for="name">
        <span>What is your name?</span>
        <span>Top Right label</span>
      </label>
      <input id="name" class="input" placeholder="Name" />
      <label class="label flex justify-between" for="name">
        <span>Bottom Left label</span>
        <span>Bottom Right label</span>
      </label>
    </fieldset>

*   Remove btn-group and input-group

btn-group, input-group were deprecated a year ago and now finally removed.  
If you've been using btn-group or input-group, you can use`join`instead

before

    <div class="btn-group">
      <button class="btn">Button 1</button>
      <button class="btn">Button 2</button>
    </div>

after

    <div class="join">
      <button class="btn join-item">Button 1</button>
      <button class="btn join-item">Button 2</button>
    </div>

daisyUI 5 release notes
=======================

Everything about the new daisyUI 5 release

Welcome! 🎉

daisyUI, the essential component library for Tailwind CSS is now being used in[360,000 open source projects](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/network/dependents), with 19 million npm installs (350 thousand weekly installs). daisyUI is growing faster than before and today it's helping many people, startups and companies to create improve their development experience.

💚 daisyUI became possible thanks to your incredible contributions, helpful feedback, and amazing support. Thank you!

Since the release of daisyUI 4 in 2023, a lot of feedback, feature requests, and bug reports have been received. Big efforts went into preparing daisyUI for this major release, using the latest web standards and new CSS/HTML features, as well as all the amazing new Tailwind CSS 4 features.

Here's daisyUI 5 with a lot of new features, improvements, and bug fixes. It's a huge update, I added TLDR for each section to make it easier to read.

Let's begin!

[](#1-core-improvement)1\. Core Improvement
-------------------------------------------

> TLDR – daisyUI 5 is compatible with Tailwind CSS 4, has zero dependencies, a smaller package size, smaller CSS size, and is more customizable. CSS variables are now more readable and more flexible.  
> [Skip to the next section](#2-build-and-integration-improvements)

### [](#tailwind-css-4-compatibility)Tailwind CSS 4 compatibility

Tailwind CSS 4 is crazy good! A lot of new features and improvements are added and also many changes to the plugin API.

daisyUI 5 works with Tailwind CSS 4 and takes advantage of all the new features.

With Tailwind CSS 4, you can now import daisyUI as a plugin in the CSS file.

Before

    // tailwind.config.{js,ts,mjs,cjs}
    module.exports = {
      content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
      plugins: [
        require('daisyui');
      ],
    }

After

    /* app.css */
    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui";
    
    
    
    
    

See[Tailwind CSS upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide)for more information.

### [](#zero-dependencies)Zero dependencies

Reducing the number of dependencies in your project is important for many reasons. It leads to faster build times and better performance in your workflow. Fewer dependencies also make your app more secure by reducing the chance of potential for vulnerabilities from less maintained packages. Also, managing a smaller dependency tree makes maintenance easier and reduces the chance of deprecation problems or version conflict in the long term.

Last year I reduced the number of dependencies in daisyUI, from ~100 (dependencies + sub dependencies in total) to 7!

This time we got rid of all the remaining ones!  
daisyUI 5 has no dependencies. Hopefully this helps to clean up your node\_modules a little bit.

Before

    Dependencies - Total 1.8 MB on disk (250 files)
      ├╴ culori
      ├╴ picocolors
      ├╴ postcss-js
      │  ╰╴ camelcase-css
      ╰╴ css-selector-tokenizer
         ├╴ cssesc
         ╰╴ fastparse

After

    No dependencies - 0 kB
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

### [](#smaller-size)Smaller size

With daisyUI as a Tailwind CSS plugin, only the needed styles are included in the final CSS file. Other than that we have made a lot of optimizations to make both package size and CSS file size smaller.

daisyUI 5 NPM package is 61% smaller in size.

Before

Install size – 4.7 MB  

After

Install size – 1.8 MB  

daisyUI 5 CDN file, including all possible class names, is 75% smaller in size

Before

full.css – 137 kB compressed  

After

daisyui.css – 34 kB compressed  

It is now safe and efficient to use the CDN file in production. The compressed CSS file, is now 34 kB only thanks to native CSS nesting and huge amount of optimizations in daisyUI 5. This is the smallest size ever for the daisyUI CDN file, including all the possible daisyUI components and colors, available for all Tailwind CSS responsive prefixes. This is a CSS file, minified, compressed and cached on CDN.

### [](#improved-color-variables)Improved color variables

With Tailwind CSS 3 and daisyUI 4, we had to extract the color values of each color into CSS variables, and pass it to Tailwind CSS alongside a special`<alpha-value>`variable so Tailwind CSS could generate opacity variables for each color utility class.

Tailwind CSS 4 doesn't have this limitation because it uses CSS`color-mix()`to control the opacity.

With daisyUI 5 we can finally put the whole color inside CSS variables. All color formats are supported, no transformation is needed no JS object is needed.

We also updated the variable names to be more readable in the output CSS, which means you can even customize the color values using the browser dev tools color picker.

Before

    /* hard to read variable names, hard to customize values */
    {
    --b1: 100% 0 0;

[](#2-build-and-integration-improvements)2\. Build and integration improvements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> TLDR – Import only the parts you need.  
> Micro CSS files are now available for no-build projects.  
> Native CSS nesting reduces CSS size.  
> It's ESM compatible and has dependency-free class name prefixing.  
> [Skip to the next section](#3-design-system-improvements)

### [](#native-css-nesting)Native CSS nesting

CSS nesting is now supported on all browsers. daisyUI 5 uses CSS nesting which prevents duplication of CSS rules and results smaller CSS size in your browser!

### [](#esm-compatibility)ESM compatibility

daisyUI 5 is now ESM (ECMAScript Module) compatible. Which means you can import and use specific parts of the library in JS if you need to.

### [](#dependency-free-class-name-prefixing)Dependency-free class name prefixing

daisyUI 5 can now prefix class names without a dependency.

### [](#micro-css-files-for-no-build-projects)Micro CSS files for No-Build projects

For server-side rendered projects (Rails, Django, PHP, etc) or projects that don't have a JS build step (HTMX, Alpine.js, WordPress, etc), it's now possible to use specific parts of daisyUI without including the entire library or even without Tailwind CSS.

For example if you only want to use daisyUI toggle component, include a tiny CSS file that only contains the styles for the toggle component:

Before

    Not possible

After

    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/components/toggle.css

All components, all themes, and basically every single part of daisyUI library[is now available as compressed. minified CSS files on CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/chunks.css).

Also, with the 75% smaller daisyui.css (formerly full.css) CDN file, it is now safe and efficient to use the CDN file in production. The compressed CSS file, is now 34 kB only thanks to native CSS nesting and huge amount of optimizations in daisyUI 5.

Check out the[CDN docs](/docs/cdn/)to customize the parts of the library you want to include in your project from the CDN.

### [](#include-and-exclude-parts-of-the-library)Include and Exclude parts of the library

Now for the first time, it's possible to include/exclude specific parts of daisyUI library. For example if you only want to use the "Toggle" component, you can include only the "Toggle" component and exclude everything else!

Before

    Not possible
    
    
    

After

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      include: toggle;
    }

Or if you want to exclude a specific part of the library, you can do that too!

Before

    Not possible
    
    
    

After

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      exclude: scrollbar;
    }

[](#3-design-system-improvements)3\. Design System Improvements
---------------------------------------------------------------

> TLDR – New "Effect" CSS variables.  
> Size improvements + new`xl`size modifier.  
> New component style modifiers:`*-soft`and`*-dash`.  
> Color format flexibility.  
> [Skip to the next section](#4-themes-and-styling)

### [](#new-effect-css-variables)New "Effect" CSS variables

daisyUI 5 introduces a new set of effects that can be enabled or disabled globally or per theme. These effects change the look and feel of relevant components, like buttons, checkbox, toggle, etc.

Currently, the following effects are available:

*   `--depth`: adds a clean, subtle depth effect to the components, making them look more visually appealing
*   `--noise`: adds a slight noise effect to the components, giving them a more textured look

These effects can be enabled or disabled using a CSS variable. Check out the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page to see how it works.

### [](#new-x-large-size)New "X-Large" size

All components that previously had`xs`,`sm`,`md`, and`lg`size modifiers now also support a new`xl`size modifier. This gives you more control over the size of components and allows you to create more flexible and responsive designs.

### [](#size-scale-improvements)Size scale improvements

With the addition of the new`xl`size modifier, the size scale of components has been adjusted to make it consistent. The new size scale is more harmonious and visually appealing.

In daisyUI 4, the size difference between sizes was not following a consistent scale.  
The new default size scale is consistent and more visually appealing ...and it's customizable!

Button height scale

Before

After

`xs`

6 × 4 = 24px

6× 4 = 24px

`sm`

8 × 4 = 32px

8× 4 = 32px

`md`

12× 4 = 48px

10× 4 = 40px

`lg`

16× 4 = 64px

12× 4 = 48px

`xl`

\-

14× 4 = 56px

Checkbox height scale

Before

After

`xs`

4 × 4 = 16px

4× 4 = 16px

`sm`

5 × 4 = 20px

5× 4 = 20px

`md`

6 × 4 = 24px

6× 4 = 24px

`lg`

8× 4 = 32px

7× 4 = 28px

`xl`

\-

8× 4 = 32px

### [](#size-scale-customization)Size scale customization

Component size scales are now customizable. Previously, customizing the size of components required a lot of manual work.  
Now everything is tokenized with CSS variables, You can define the size scale of the components globally or per theme, making them shorter or taller, based on your design needs.

*   `--size-field`variable is used to define the base size of fields like input, button, tab, etc.
*   `--size-selector`variable is used to define the base size of selectors like checkbox, radio, toggle, badge, etc.

See how it works in the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page.

### [](#border-size-customization)Border size customization

Border size of buttons, inputs, tab, et are now customizable globally or per theme.

*   `--border`variable is used to define the border size of components like button, input, tab, etc.

See how it works in the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page.

### [](#new-component-styles-soft-and-dash)New component styles: "soft" and "dash"

Components like`button`,`badge`,`alert`now have`soft`and`dash`styles.  
`soft`style makes the component look softer and`dash`style adds a dashed border to the component.

### [](#all-modifier-classes-are-now-responsive)All modifier classes are now responsive

daisyUI 5 makes all modifiers responsive by default. This means you can use responsive modifiers like`md:`,`lg:`, etc. with all component modifier classes, not just a selected few.

### [](#color-format-flexibility)Color format flexibility

daisyUI 5 supports all color formats and doesn't convert your colors to a specific format.

Before Tailwind CSS 4, color values of utility classes had to be generated at build time so the only way to have CSS variables for colors and being able to use Tailwind CSS opacity modifiers was to use a specific color format and pass it tailwind to generate the opacity variables.  
Tailwind CSS 4 now uses CSS variables for colors and`color-mix()`to control the opacity. This means we can use any color format we want and no transformation is needed.  
daisyUI built-in themes still use OKLCH color format and I would recommend using OKLCH for custom themes too, but you can use any color format you want and neither daisyUI nor Tailwind CSS will convert it to another format at build time.

[](#4-themes-and-styling)4\. Themes and styling
-----------------------------------------------

Themes and colors are what makes your website unique. We've made significant improvements to the themes and colors in daisyUI 5, including new themes, improved existing themes, and a new Theme Generator to help you create your own custom themes.

> TLDR – New themes + improved existing themes.  
> New Theme Generator to create custom themes.  
> [Skip to the next section](#5-new-components)

### [](#new-themes)New themes

daisyUI 5 includes 3 new themes:

*   `caramellatte`– Warm, cozy, light theme featuring brown and beige
*   `abyss`– Deep dark green, teal and phosphorus color palette
*   `silk`– Bright, clean and bold theme with fluorescent text colors

### [](#existing-themes-improvements)Existing themes improvements

Most daisyUI themes have been adjusted to look better and consistent. color contrast and accessibility got even better and the colors are more harmonious. These changes make the color more visually appealing and easier to read.

### [](#all-new-theme-generator)All-new Theme Generator

Check out the new[Theme Generator](/theme-generator/)page to create your own custom theme. Create, customize or extend themes, or generate stunning new themes using the new daisyUI color palette generator algorithm.

[](#5-new-components)5\. New components
---------------------------------------

daisyUI 5 introduces new components to help you build websites faster.

> TLDR – New components:`List`,`Status`,`Fieldset`,`Label`,`Filter`,`Calendar`,`Validator`,`Dock`.  
> [Skip to the next section](#6-major-component-improvements)

### [](#list)List

List is is useful for vertical layout to display information in rows. Imagine a list of products, list of people, list of articles, etc.

See[List component docs](/components/list/)

### [](#status)Status

Status is a really small icon to visually show the current status of an element, like online, offline, error, etc.

Available in 5 sizes:`xs`,`sm`,`md`,`lg`, and`xl`.

> [Skip to the next section](#13-breaking-changes-in-themes)

*   Tailwind CSS 4 allows config directly from the CSS file, so instead of`tailwind.config.js`you need to put the daisyUI config in the CSS file.[See the new config format](/docs/config/).
*   `themes`config is a comma separated list of theme names. Read more about[daisyUI config](/docs/config/)and[daisyUI themes](/docs/themes/).

*   `themeRoot`config was renamed to`root`.
*   `styled: false`config was removed in favor of providing micro CSS files and the ability to include/exclude parts of the library. Disabling themes will remove all colors, but component are no longer distributed into two chunk of unstyled styled. You can now include/exclude each component individually.
*   `base: false`config was removed in favor of include/exclude config where you can include/exclude each component individually.
*   `utils: false`config was removed in favor of include/exclude config where you can include/exclude each component individually.

[](#13-breaking-changes-in-themes)13\. Breaking changes in themes
-----------------------------------------------------------------

> TLDR – Automatic`*-content`color calculation is removed. Theme variable names have changed for better consistency and readability. Previous themes are available for easy migration.  
> [Skip to the next section](#14-bug-fixes)

Automatic`*-content`color calculation based on background color was removed. Now that Tailwind CSS supports CSS variables for colors, we no longer process and convert color values at build time. You can use any color format you want and neither daisyUI nor Tailwind CSS will convert it to another format at build time.

Most themes have been adjusted to look better and consistent. color contrast and accessibility got even better and the colors are more harmonious. These changes make the color more visually appealing and easier to read.  
If you prefer using the previous colors, I[prepared a repo, including all daisyUI 4 theme colors](https://github.com/daisyui/v4-themes-for-v5/)easy to copy/paste in daisyUI 5.

All color variable names have been changed to be aligned with new Tailwind CSS 4 syntax. And to be more readable and easier to customize[See the new color format](#improved-color-variables)

[](#14-bug-fixes)14\. Bug fixes
-------------------------------

> TLDR – More than 95% of all the open issues from daisyUI 4 have been fixed in this release.  
> [Skip to the next section](#15-get-started-with-daisyui-5)

Some of these bugs were fixed automatically by the new changes in changes in the core library, design system, themes, and components. Some of them became possible with the new capabilities of Tailwind CSS 4.

And some of these bugs were related to a specific structure / style / behavior of components and changing them in a patch release would have caused breaking changes for all existing projects. We had to wait for the major release to apply these changes.

If you've been waiting for a specific bug fix, here are the bugs that have been fixed in this release. Let me know if I miss any bug or let me know if a bug is closed by mistake 💚

Customize daisyUI components
============================

How to customize daisyUI?

daisyUI components come with many variants necessary for design systems and you won't usually need to customize anything.

But you can still customize components in many ways.

*   Let's say, you want to customize this button:

    <button class="btn">Button</button>

Button

1.  You can use daisyUI utility classes:

    <button class="btn btn-primary">One</button>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary">Two</button>
    <button class="btn btn-accent btn-outline">Three</button>

One Two Three

2.  You can use Tailwind's utility classes:

    <button class="btn rounded-full">One</button>
    <button class="btn rounded-none px-16">Two</button>

One Two

3.  You can customize components on your CSS file, using Tailwind's @apply directive:

    @utility btn {
      @apply rounded-full;
    }

Config
======

How to change the default configuration of daisyUI?

daisyUI can be configured from your CSS file.

Replace the semicolon`;`after`@plugin "daisyui"`with brackets`{}`and add the configuration inside the brackets.

app.css

    - @plugin "daisyui";
    + @plugin "daisyui" {
    + }

Default config:

app.css

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark;
      root: ":root";
      include: ;
      exclude: ;
      prefix: ;
      logs: true;
    }

[](#themes)Themes
-----------------

Default value

Type

Description

`light --default, dark --prefersdark`

string or comma separated list or`false`or`all`

List of themes to enable. Use`false`to disable all themes. Use`all`to enable all themes. Add`--default`flag next to a theme name to set it as default theme. Add`--prefersdark`flag next to a theme name to set it as default theme for dark mode.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: nord --default, abyss --prefersdark, cupcake, dracula;
    }

In above example, we have 4 themes:`nord`,`abyss`,`cupcake`, and`dracula`. nord is the default theme, abyss is the default theme for dark mode, and cupcake and dracula are available to use with`data-theme="cupcake"`and`data-theme="dracula"`.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: all;
    }

In above example, we enable all themes.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: false;
    }

In above example, we disable all themes. it's useful to disable all themes and add custom themes using[`@plugin "daisyui/theme"`](/docs/themes/#how-to-add-a-new-custom-theme)

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: dracula --default;
    }

In above example, we set dracula as the default theme. setting one value like this means only one theme will be available. Unless you add custom themes using[`@plugin "daisyui/theme"`](/docs/themes/#how-to-add-a-new-custom-theme)

[](#root)root
-------------

Default value

Type

Description

`":root"`

string

The CSS selector to receive the CSS variables.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      root: "#my-app";
    }

In above example, we set the CSS variables on`#my-app`instead of`:root`. This way all daisyUI global CSS variables will be scoped to`#my-app`.  
This is useful to use daisyUI in a scoped environment like a web component or a shadow DOM or a specific part of the page.

[](#include)include
-------------------

Default value

Type

Description

comma separated list

List of components to include.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      include: button, input, select;
    }

In above example, we only include the button, input, and select components. All other styles of daisyUI library will be excluded.  
[Here are the file names you can include or exclude](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/tree/master/packages/daisyui/src).

[](#exclude)exclude
-------------------

Default value

Type

Description

comma separated list

List of components to exclude.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      exclude: rootscrollgutter;
    }

In above example, we exclude the`rootscrollgutter`style which is added to the`:root`when a modal or drawer is open.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      exclude: checkbox, footer, typography, glass, rootcolor, rootscrollgutter;
    }

In above example, we exclude the the listed files. All other parts of daisyUI will be available to use. This is useful if you want to opt out of some parts of daisyUI or if you want to mix daisyUI for some parts and another library for the rest.  
[Here are the file names you can include or exclude](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/tree/master/packages/daisyui/src).

[](#prefix)prefix
-----------------

Default value

Type

Description

`""`

string

Prefix for all daisyUI classes.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      prefix: "d-";
    }

In above example, all daisyUI classes will be prefixed with`d-`. For example,`btn`will be`d-btn`.

[](#logs)logs
-------------

Default value

Type

Description

`true`

boolean

Enable or disable logs.

Example

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      logs: false;

How to use daisyUI colors?

[](#introduction)Introduction
-----------------------------

daisyUI is fully themeable and colorable, So instead of using constant color utility classes like:

*   bg-green-500
*   bg-orange-600
*   bg-blue-700
*   etc.

It's suggested to use semantic color utility classes like:

*   bg-primary
*   bg-secondary
*   bg-accent
*   etc.

Each color name contains CSS variables and each daisyUI theme applies color values to the utility classes when it is applied.

[](#benefits)Benefits
---------------------

Semantic color names make more sense because when we design interfaces, we don't just use any random color. We define a specific color palette with names like `primary`, `secondary`, etc. and we only use those specific colors in our interfaces. Also, using semantic color names makes theming easier. You wouldn't have to define dark-mode colors for every single element and you wouldn't be limited to only light/dark themes. you can have multiple themes available and each theme is just a few lines of CSS variables.

Example of theming a div with hardcoded color values

_Using hardcoded color names_

This is a hardcoded dark text on a light background, it needs double the amount of class names to support dark mode.

    <div class="bg-zinc-100">
      <div class="bg-zinc-50 border-zinc-200 text-zinc-800">
        This is a hardcoded dark text on a light background,
        it needs double the amount of class names to support dark mode.
      </div>
    </div>

*   🪦 Fixed color names, hardcoded based on the value
*   🚫 No automatic dark mode
*   😵‍💫 You have to add dark-mode colors for every element
*   💸 high maintenance cost
*   🐢 slow development
*   😩 hard to change a theme
*   ⛓️‍💥 high chance of inconsistency
*   😰 You are limited to 2 themes only: light and dark

_Using semantic color names_

This is dark text on a light background, which switches to light text on a dark background in dark mode.

    <div class="bg-base-200">
      <div class="bg-base-100 border-base-300 text-base-content">
        This is dark text on a light background,
        which switches to light text on a dark background in dark mode.
      </div>
    </div>

*   🎯 Semantic names, based on the purpose of the color
*   ✨ Automatic dark mode
*   🌓 No need to add any dark-mode class names
*   🤑 Zero maintenance cost to add a theme
*   🚀 Fast development
*   ⚡️ Easy to change themes
*   📘 All colors are consistent based on the design system
*   ♾️ Unlimited themes, easy to switch

[](#list-of-all-daisyui-color-names)List of all daisyUI color names

[](#how-to-use)How to use
-------------------------

Some daisyUI components come with modifier class names and that modifier class name will apply a color. For example:

    <button class="btn btn-primary">Button</button>

Or:

    <input type="checkbox" class="checkbox checkbox-secondary" />

These components automatically set the correct background color, text color, border color, etc as needed so you don't need to set those colors manually. For example`btn-primary`sets`primary`color for background and border, and sets`primary-content`color for the text automatically as default. You can customize them using utility classes if you want to change the color.

You can also use color names in utility classes just like Tailwind's original color names. These are utility classes that can be used with a color name:

CSS Class

`bg-{COLOR_NAME}`

Also available on CDN[/colors/properties.css](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/colors/properties.css)

`text-{COLOR_NAME}`

[](#color-opacity-and-muted-colors)Color opacity and muted colors
-----------------------------------------------------------------

`base-content`is the text color of the page by default. It's a dark color on light themes and it's a light color on dark themes.

nord theme

text-base-content

dracula theme

text-base-content

Sometimes we need a muted text. something with less contrast. The best way to do this is using Tailwind CSS color opacity modifier by adding a`/50`(or any other value) to the end of color name. Like`text-base-content/50`

nord theme

text-base-content

text-base-content/70

text-base-content/50

text-base-content/30

dracula theme

text-base-content

text-base-content/70

text-base-content/50

text-base-content/30

The advantage of using opacity is that it gives a constant result on all themes, for all colors.  
You can use it with any opacity value, you can use it for any color. For example primary-content:

nord theme

text-primary-content

text-primary-content/50

dracula theme

text-primary-content

text-primary-content/50

daisyUI themes
==============

How to use daisyUI themes?

daisyUI comes with 35 built-in themes that instantly transform your website's entire look - a time-saver that lets you focus on building rather than deciding on colors.  
You can also create your own custom themes or customize built-in themes.

You can manage themes by adding brackets in front of`@plugin "daisyui"`in your CSS file.

app.css

      @import "tailwindcss";
    - @plugin "daisyui";
    + @plugin "daisyui" {
    +   themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark;
    + }

*   `themes`is a comma-separated list of theme names you want to enable.
*   You can set`--default`flag for a theme to make it the default theme.
*   You can also set`--prefersdark`flag for a theme to make it the default theme for dark mode (prefers-color-scheme: dark).

[](#enable-a-built-in-theme)Enable a built-in theme
---------------------------------------------------

By default,`light`and`dark`themes are enabled. Let's enable`cupcake`theme:

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark, cupcake;
    }

And set`cupcake`theme for the page:

index.html

    <html data-theme="cupcake"></html>

> I suggest using [theme-change](https://github.com/saadeghi/theme-change), so you can switch themes and save selected theme in local storage.

[](#enable-all-themes)Enable all themes
---------------------------------------

Enable all 35 built-in themes by setting`themes`to`all`:

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: all;
    }

[](#disable-a-theme)Disable a theme
-----------------------------------

To disable`dark`theme for example, remove it from the list. Now only light theme is included:

app.css

     @import "tailwindcss";
     @plugin "daisyui" {
    -  themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark;
    +  themes: light --default;
     }

If for some reason you want to disable all themes and remove all daisyUI colors, set`themes`to`false`:

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: false;
    }

[](#how-to-use-a-theme-only-for-a-section-of-a-page)How to use a theme only for a section of a page?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add `data-theme='THEME_NAME'` to any element and everything inside will have your theme. You can nest themes and there is no limit! You can force a section of your HTML to only use a specific theme.

index.html

    <html data-theme="dark">
      <div data-theme="light">
        This div will always use light theme
        <span data-theme="retro">This span will always use retro theme!</span>
      </div>
    </html>

[](#how-to-add-a-new-custom-theme)How to add a new custom theme?
----------------------------------------------------------------

To add a new theme, use`@plugin "daisyui/theme" {}`in your CSS file, with the following structure:

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui";
    @plugin "daisyui/theme" {
      name: "mytheme";
      default: true; /* set as default */
      prefersdark: false; /* set as default dark mode (prefers-color-scheme:dark) */
      color-scheme: light; /* color of browser-provided UI */
    
      --color-base-100: oklch(98% 0.02 240);
      --color-base-200: oklch(95% 0.03 240);
      --color-base-300: oklch(92% 0.04 240);
      --color-base-content: oklch(20% 0.05 240);
      --color-primary: oklch(55% 0.3 240);
      --color-primary-content: oklch(98% 0.01 240);
      --color-secondary: oklch(70% 0.25 200);
      --color-secondary-content: oklch(98% 0.01 200);
      --color-accent: oklch(65% 0.25 160);
      --color-accent-content: oklch(98% 0.01 160);
      --color-neutral: oklch(50% 0.05 240);
      --color-neutral-content: oklch(98% 0.01 240);
      --color-info: oklch(70% 0.2 220);
      --color-info-content: oklch(98% 0.01 220);
      --color-success: oklch(65% 0.25 140);
      --color-success-content: oklch(98% 0.01 140);
      --color-warning: oklch(80% 0.25 80);
      --color-warning-content: oklch(20% 0.05 80);
      --color-error: oklch(65% 0.3 30);
      --color-error-content: oklch(98% 0.01 30);
    
      /* border radius */
      --radius-selector: 1rem;
      --radius-field: 0.25rem;
      --radius-box: 0.5rem;
    
      /* base sizes */
      --size-selector: 0.25rem;
      --size-field: 0.25rem;
    
      /* border size */
      --border: 1px;
    
      /* effects */
      --depth: 1;
      --noise: 0;
    }

If you're using CDN and you want to use a custom theme, use it like this:

app.css

    :root:has(input.theme-controller[value=mytheme]:checked),[data-theme="mytheme"] { /* mytheme is the name of the custom theme */
      color-scheme: light;
      --color-base-100: oklch(98% 0.02 240);
      /* ...rest of CSS variables like above example */
    }

[](#how-to-customize-an-existing-theme)How to customize an existing theme?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To customize a built-in theme, you can use the same structure as adding a new theme, but with the same name as the built-in theme. For example, to customize the`light`theme:

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui";
    @plugin "daisyui/theme" {
      name: "light";
      default: true;
      --color-primary: blue;
      --color-secondary: teal;
    }

All the other values will be inherited from the original theme.

[](#how-to-add-custom-styles-for-a-specific-theme)How to add custom styles for a specific theme?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can write custom style for your elements only for a specific theme. In this example, .my-btn class only will have this style on light theme.

app.css

    [data-theme="light"] {
      .my-btn {
        background-color: #1EA1F1;
        border-color: #1EA1F1;
      }
      .my-btn:hover {
        background-color: #1C96E1;
        border-color: #1C96E1;
      }
    }

[](#how-to-apply-tailwinds-dark-selector-for-specific-themes)How to apply Tailwind's 'dark:' selector for specific themes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

daisyUI can be configured to use Tailwind's \`dark:\` prefix For example if you want a padding only for a daisyUI dark theme you can use \`dark:p-10\` In the example below, 'night' is darkmode theme so we add it to \`@variant dark\`

app.css

    @import "tailwindcss";
    @plugin "daisyui" {
      themes: winter --default, night --prefersdark;
    }
    
    @custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme=night], [data-theme=night] *));

index.html

    <div class="p-10 dark:p-20">
      I will have 10 padding on winter theme and 20 padding on night theme
    </div>

daisyUI base style
==================

daisyUI adds a few base styles to your page.

These are the tiny base styles that daisyUI adds to your page. These styles are less than a kilobyte in total, so you don't need to worry about the size

Name

Description

`properties`

For necessary at-rules, like variable type for`--radialprogress`

`rootcolor`

For`:root`and`[data-theme]`it sets background-color to`base-100`and text color to`base-content`

`scrollbar`

Sets scrollbar-color for`:root`

`rootscrolllock`

Sets`:root`to`overflow: hidden`when modal or drawer is open

`rootscrollgutter`

Adds a`scrollbar-gutter`to`:root`when modal or drawer is open, to avoid layout shift

`svg`

Contains small SVG images for noise filter, chat bubble tail mask, and tooltip tail mask. Can be disabled to use custom images.

If you want to opt out of each part, you can do it by setting the[`exclude` config](/docs/config/#exclude).  
For example, to opt out of the scrollbar-gutter and style, scrollbar-color, you can exclude it like this:

    @plugin "daisyui" {
      exclude: rootscrollgutter, rootcolor;
    }

Or if you're using CDN, you can disable it from your[customized CDN file](/docs/cdn/)if you need to.

For advanced use: These CSS variables are being used internally for a specific components. You probably won't need to customize them, but you can if you want to.

If you are using a prefix for daisyUI, these CSS variables will be prefixed with that prefix as well. For example if prefix is`daisy-`, The`--alert-color`CSS variable will be`--daisy-alert-color`.

> These variables are for internal use. They are not subject of semantic versioning and some of them may be modified or removed in future minor versions, in which case your custom styles might lose their effect, so if you want to modify these variables and your UI really depends on the customized value, make sure you are using a fixed version of daisyUI, not the latest version.

Layout and Typography
=====================

How to use layouts and typography in daisyUI

### [](#layout)Layout

Layout, sizing, grids, spacing, etc. all will be handled by Tailwind CSS's utility classes.  
Read more at Tailwind CSS documentation:  
[Layout](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container),[Sizing](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width),[Flexbox](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex),[Grid](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-template-columns),[Box alignment](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/justify-content),[Spacing](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding)

### [](#typography)Typography

daisyUI supports the[TailwindCSS Typography plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)  
All parts are compatible with daisyUI themes.

* * *

Here's a demo text to demonstrate the Tailwind CSS Typography plugin in combination with daisyUI colors:

Tailwind CSS Typography plugin demo
===================================

This is a demo of the Tailwind CSS Typography plugin in action. The plugin provides a set of prose classes that can be used to style your HTML content with minimal effort. When combined with daisyUI, you get access to a variety of themes that are fully compatible with the Typography plugin.

[](#headers-making-a-statement)Headers: Making a Statement
----------------------------------------------------------

Headers are essential for structuring your content and making it easy to read. With Tailwind CSS Typography and daisyUI, you can create headers that stand out and match your chosen theme.

The Big Heading, for the Page Title
===================================

[](#second-heading-for-the-page-subtitle)Second Heading, for the Page Subtitle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#third-heading-usually-for-the-section-title)Third Heading, usually for the Section Title

#### [](#fourth-heading-usually-for-the-subsection-title)Fourth Heading, usually for the Subsection Title

##### [](#fifth-heading-for-the-subsubsection-title)Fifth Heading, for the Subsubsection Title

###### [](#sixth-heading-for-the-paragraph-title)Sixth Heading, for the Paragraph Title

[](#text-formatting-adding-emphasis)Text Formatting: Adding Emphasis
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Text formatting is crucial for emphasizing important information. Tailwind CSS Typography makes it simple to apply bold, italic, and other text styles.

### [](#bold-and-italic)Bold and Italic

*   **Bold**text is perfect for highlighting key points.
*   _Italic_text is great for emphasizing specific words.
*   **_Bold and Italic_**text can be used for extra emphasis.

### [](#blockquotes)Blockquotes

Blockquotes are an excellent way to highlight quotes or important information. They are styled beautifully with the Typography plugin.

> "This is a blockquote. It stands out and draws attention to important information. In HTML, blockquotes are created using the`<blockquote>`tag. When used with the Typography plugin and daisyUI, blockquotes receive special styling that includes indentation and a different background color - making quoted text visually distinct from the rest of the content. This styling helps create clear visual hierarchy and improves readability while maintaining semantic HTML markup."

[](#lists-organizing-information)Lists: Organizing Information
--------------------------------------------------------------

Lists are a great way to organize information in a structured manner. Tailwind CSS Typography makes it easy to create both unordered and ordered lists.

### [](#unordered-lists)Unordered Lists

Unordered lists use bullet points to list items. They are perfect for listing items without a specific order.

*   First item
*   Second item
    *   Subitem one
    *   Subitem two

### [](#ordered-lists)Ordered Lists

Ordered lists use numbers to list items. They are ideal for steps or items that need to be in a specific order.

1.  Step one
2.  Step two
    1.  Substep one
    2.  Substep two

[](#links-and-images-adding-interactivity)Links and Images: Adding Interactivity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#links)Links

Links are essential for navigation and adding interactivity to your content. Tailwind CSS Typography ensures that links are styled consistently.

### [](#images)Images

Images are a great way to enhance your content visually. The Typography plugin makes sure they are displayed beautifully.

[](#code-showcasing-your-work)Code: Showcasing Your Work
--------------------------------------------------------

Code snippets are crucial for technical content. Tailwind CSS Typography provides excellent styling for both inline code and code blocks.

### [](#inline-code)Inline Code

Inline code is perfect for highlighting small pieces of code within a sentence.

Here is an example of inline code:`console.log('Hello, world!');`

### [](#code-blocks)Code Blocks

Code blocks are ideal for displaying larger pieces of code. You can use Shiki, Prism or other libraries for code highlighting.

    function greet() {
      console.log('Hello, world!');
    }

[](#tables-organizing-data)Tables: Organizing Data
--------------------------------------------------

Tables are essential for organizing data in rows and columns. Tailwind CSS Typography ensures that tables are styled consistently and look great.

[](#method-2-popover-api-and-anchor-positioning)Method 2. popover API and anchor positioning`new`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Popover API is the new HTML standard for creating dropdowns. It opens the dropdown on a top layer, which means there's no need to z-index management and there's no overflow issue.  
Anchor positioning is a new CSS standard for positioning elements relative to an anchor.

Structure

    <button
      style="anchor-name:--anchor-1"  ────────────────╮
      popovertarget="popover-1"   ───────╮            │

      id="popover-1"   ──────────────────╯            │
      style="position-anchor:--anchor-1"  ────────────╯
    >Content</div>

> `popovertarget`is the unique ID of the popover content.  
> `anchor-name`/`position-anchor`is the unique name of the anchor.

> CSS Anchor Positioning is a new standard but isn't yet supported in Firefox and Safari ([caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/css-anchor-positioning)).  
> In those browsers, the dropdown will appear centered like a modal.  
> There's also[this polyfill](https://github.com/oddbird/css-anchor-positioning)that can be helpful.

                               Content shown when button is focused

> Why div?  
> Safari has a[CSS bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22261)since 2008 that prevents button elements from being focused, so we use div`tabindex="0"`as a workaround. This approach is accessible with the addition of`role="button"`and functions consistently across all browsers.

> This dropdown closes when focus is lost. Avoid placing elements in it that remove focus from dropdown content. For example a`<dialog>`element inside the dropdown.

> To close the dropdown after click, you can use something like`onclick="document.activeElement.blur()"`.[Example](https://play.tailwindcss.com/pc8zXb89lM)

[](#there-are-3-methods-to-use-modals)There are 3 methods to use modals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  [Using HTML `<dialog>` element](#method-1-html-dialog-element)  
    It needs JS to open but it has better accessibility and we can close it using`Esc`key
2.  [Using checkbox](#method-2-checkbox)  
    A hidden`<input type="checkbox">`to control the sate of modal and`<label>`to check/uncheck the checkbox and open/close the modal
3.  [Using `<a>` anchor links](#method-3-using-anchor-links)  
    A link adds a parameter to the URL and you only see the modal when the URL has that parameter

> Opening a modal adds a[scrollbar-gutter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter)to the page to avoid layout shift on operating systems that have a fixed scrollbar.  
> If you don't want to use this feature,[you can exclude `rootscrollgutter`](/docs/config/#exclude).

[](#method-1-html-dialog-element)Method 1. HTML dialog element`recommended`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML dialog element is a native way to create modals. It is accessible and we can close the modal using`Esc`key.  
We can open the modal using JS`ID.showModal()`method and close it using`ID.close()`method.  
The ID must be unique for each modal.

[](#modal-that-closes-when-clicked-outside)

#### Modal that closes when clicked outside

Modal works with a hidden checkbox and labels can toggle the checkbox so we can use another label tag with 'modal-backdrop' class that covers the screen so we can close the modal when clicked outside

### [](#method-3-using-anchor-links)Method 3. using anchor links`legacy`

A link adds a parameter to the URL and you only see the modal when the URL has that parameter  
When modal is closed, the page will scroll to the top because of the anchor link. Anchor links might not work well on some SPA frameworks. If there are problems, use the other methods

Accordion
=========

Accordion is used for showing and hiding content but only one item can stay open at a time.

> Accordion uses the same style as the[collapse component](/components/collapse/)but it works with radio inputs. You can control which item to be open by checking/unchecking the hidden radio input.

> All radio inputs with the same name work together and only one of them can be open at a time. If you have more than one set of accordion items on a page, use different names for the radio inputs on each set.

What kind of nonsense is this

Put me on the Council and not make me a Master!??

That's never been done in the history of the Jedi.

It's insulting!

Calm down, Anakin.

You have been given a great honor.

To be on the Council at your age.

It's never happened before.

Radial progress
===============

Radial progress can be used to show the progress of a task or to show the passing of time.

Class name

Type

radial-progress

Component

Shows a radial progress

> Radial progress needs`--value`CSS variable to work.  
> To change the size, use`--size`CSS variable which has a default value of`5rem`.  
> To change the thickness, use`--thickness`CSS variable which is 10% of the size by default.

> For Radial progress we need to use a`div`instead of the`progress`tag because browsers can't show text inside`progress`tag, and Firefox doesn’t render pseudo-elements inside`progress`tag at all.  
> Adding`role="progressbar"`makes it accessible to screen readers as well.

Validator
=========

Validator class changes the color of form elements to error or success based on input's validation rules.

Class name

Type

validator

Component

For input, select, textarea

validator-hint

Part

for the hint text that appears after the input if it's invalid

[](#validator)

#### Validator

writing an invalid email address applies error color to the input. Valid email address applies success color.

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />

            
                

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />

              
          

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />

[](#validator-and-validator-hint)

#### Validator and validator-hint

If value is invalid, a hint text appears below the input.

Enter valid email address

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />
    <div class="$$validator-hint">Enter valid email address</div>

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />
    <div class="$$validator-hint">Enter valid email address</div>

            
                

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />
    <div class="$$validator-hint">Enter valid email address</div>

              
          

    <input class="$$input $$validator" type="email" required placeholder="[email protected]" />
    <div class="$$validator-hint">Enter valid email address</div>

> `validator-hint`class will be invisible if it comes after a`validator`class, then if the input is invalid,`validator-hint`will get visible.  
> `validator-hint`still occupies space even if it's invisible because we don't want a layout shift when the hint appears.  
> If you prefer to hide the hint when it's not visible, add`hidden`class to`validator-hint`. It will take no space when it's hidden, and if input is invalid, it will appear and take space.

### [](#structure)Structure

Drawer is a grid layout that can show/hide a sidebar on the left or right side of the page, based on the screen size or based on the value of a`drawer-toggle`checkbox.  
Drawer must be the parent element of the content and sidebar.

Structure

    .drawer // The root container
      ├── .drawer-toggle // A hidden checkbox to toggle the visibility of the sidebar
      ├── .drawer-content // All your page content goes here
      │    ╰── // navbar, content, footer
      │
      ╰── .drawer-side // Sidebar wrapper
           ├── .drawer-overlay // A dark overlay that covers the whole page when the drawer is open
           ╰── // Sidebar content (menu or anything)

### [](#functionality)Functionality

Drawer sidebar is hidden by default. You can make it visible on larger screens using`lg:drawer-open`class (or using other responsive prefixes: sm, md, lg, xl)

You can check/uncheck the checkbox using JavaScript or by clicking the`label`tag which is assigned to the hidden checkbox

> Opening a drawer adds a[scrollbar-gutter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter)to the page to avoid layout shift on operating systems that have a fixed scrollbar.  
> If you don't want to use this feature,[you can exclude `rootscrollgutter`](/docs/config/#exclude).
