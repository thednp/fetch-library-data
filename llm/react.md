React Reference Overview[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==============================================================

This section provides detailed reference documentation for working with React. For an introduction to React, please visit the [Learn](/learn) section.

The React reference documentation is broken down into functional subsections:

React[](#react "Link for React ")
---------------------------------

Programmatic React features:

*   [Hooks](/reference/react/hooks) - Use different React features from your components.
*   [Components](/reference/react/components) - Built-in components that you can use in your JSX.
*   [APIs](/reference/react/apis) - APIs that are useful for defining components.
*   [Directives](/reference/rsc/directives) - Provide instructions to bundlers compatible with React Server Components.

React DOM[](#react-dom "Link for React DOM ")
---------------------------------------------

React-dom contains features that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). This section is broken into the following:

*   [Hooks](/reference/react-dom/hooks) - Hooks for web applications which run in the browser DOM environment.
*   [Components](/reference/react-dom/components) - React supports all of the browser built-in HTML and SVG components.
*   [APIs](/reference/react-dom) - The `react-dom` package contains methods supported only in web applications.
*   [Client APIs](/reference/react-dom/client) - The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser).
*   [Server APIs](/reference/react-dom/server) - The `react-dom/server` APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server.

Rules of React[](#rules-of-react "Link for Rules of React ")
------------------------------------------------------------

React has idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications:

*   [Components and Hooks must be pure](/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure) – Purity makes your code easier to understand, debug, and allows React to automatically optimize your components and hooks correctly.
*   [React calls Components and Hooks](/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks) – React is responsible for rendering components and hooks when necessary to optimize the user experience.
*   [Rules of Hooks](/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) – Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.

Legacy APIs[](#legacy-apis "Link for Legacy APIs ")
---------------------------------------------------

*   [Legacy APIs](/reference/react/legacy) - Exported from the `react` package, but not recommended for use in newly written code.

[API Reference](/reference/react)

Built-in React Hooks[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==========================================================

_Hooks_ let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.

* * *

State Hooks[](#state-hooks "Link for State Hooks ")
---------------------------------------------------

_State_ lets a component [“remember” information like user input.](/learn/state-a-components-memory) For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.

To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:

*   [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) declares a state variable that you can update directly.
*   [`useReducer`](/reference/react/useReducer) declares a state variable with the update logic inside a [reducer function.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

    function ImageGallery() {  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);  // ...

* * *

Context Hooks[](#context-hooks "Link for Context Hooks ")
---------------------------------------------------------

_Context_ lets a component [receive information from distant parents without passing it as props.](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep.

*   [`useContext`](/reference/react/useContext) reads and subscribes to a context.

    function Button() {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  // ...

* * *

Ref Hooks[](#ref-hooks "Link for Ref Hooks ")
---------------------------------------------

_Refs_ let a component [hold some information that isn’t used for rendering,](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs.

*   [`useRef`](/reference/react/useRef) declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.
*   [`useImperativeHandle`](/reference/react/useImperativeHandle) lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.

    function Form() {  const inputRef = useRef(null);  // ...

* * *

Effect Hooks[](#effect-hooks "Link for Effect Hooks ")
------------------------------------------------------

_Effects_ let a component [connect to and synchronize with external systems.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.

*   [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) connects a component to an external system.

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [roomId]);  // ...

Effects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, [you might not need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

There are two rarely used variations of `useEffect` with differences in timing:

*   [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.
*   [`useInsertionEffect`](/reference/react/useInsertionEffect) fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.

* * *

Performance Hooks[](#performance-hooks "Link for Performance Hooks ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.

To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:

*   [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
*   [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.

    function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);  // ...}

Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).

To prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:

*   [`useTransition`](/reference/react/useTransition) lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.
*   [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue) lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.

* * *

Other Hooks[](#other-hooks "Link for Other Hooks ")
---------------------------------------------------

These Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code.

*   [`useDebugValue`](/reference/react/useDebugValue) lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.
*   [`useId`](/reference/react/useId) lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.
*   [`useSyncExternalStore`](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) lets a component subscribe to an external store.

*   [`useActionState`](/reference/react/useActionState) allows you to manage state of actions.

* * *

Your own Hooks[](#your-own-hooks "Link for Your own Hooks ")
------------------------------------------------------------

You can also [define your own custom Hooks](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#extracting-your-own-custom-hook-from-a-component) as JavaScript functions.

[Hooks](/reference/react/hooks)

useActionState[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
====================================================

`useActionState` is a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.

    const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(fn, initialState, permalink?);

### Note

In earlier React Canary versions, this API was part of React DOM and called `useFormState`.

*   [Reference](#reference)
    *   [`useActionState(action, initialState, permalink?)`](#useactionstate)
*   [Usage](#usage)
    *   [Using information returned by a form action](#using-information-returned-by-a-form-action)
*   [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
    *   [My action can no longer read the submitted form data](#my-action-can-no-longer-read-the-submitted-form-data)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useActionState(action, initialState, permalink?)`[](#useactionstate "Link for this heading")

Call `useActionState` at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated [when a form action is invoked](/reference/react-dom/components/form). You pass `useActionState` an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided.

    import { useActionState } from "react";async function increment(previousState, formData) {  return previousState + 1;}function StatefulForm({}) {  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);  return (    <form>      {state}      <button formAction={formAction}>Increment</button>    </form>  )}

The form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass.

If used with a Server Function, `useActionState` allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `fn`: The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the `initialState` that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives.
*   `initialState`: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked.
*   **optional** `permalink`: A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies. For use on pages with dynamic content (eg: feeds) in conjunction with progressive enhancement: if `fn` is a [server function](/reference/rsc/server-functions) and the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads, the browser will navigate to the specified permalink URL, rather than the current page’s URL. Ensure that the same form component is rendered on the destination page (including the same action `fn` and `permalink`) so that React knows how to pass the state through. Once the form has been hydrated, this parameter has no effect.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useActionState` returns an array with the following values:

1.  The current state. During the first render, it will match the `initialState` you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action.
2.  A new action that you can pass as the `action` prop to your `form` component or `formAction` prop to any `button` component within the form. The action can also be called manually within [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition).
3.  The `isPending` flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   When used with a framework that supports React Server Components, `useActionState` lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state.
*   The function passed to `useActionState` receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using `useActionState`.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Using information returned by a form action[](#using-information-returned-by-a-form-action "Link for Using information returned by a form action ")

Call `useActionState` at the top level of your component to access the return value of an action from the last time a form was submitted.

    import { useActionState } from 'react';import { action } from './actions.js';function MyComponent() {  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(action, null);  // ...  return (    <form action={formAction}>      {/* ... */}    </form>  );}

`useActionState` returns an array with the following items:

1.  The current state of the form, which is initially set to the initial state you provided, and after the form is submitted is set to the return value of the action you provided.
2.  A new action that you pass to `<form>` as its `action` prop or call manually within `startTransition`.
3.  A pending state that you can utilise while your action is processing.

When the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form.

The action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called. The rest of the arguments are the same as if `useActionState` had not been used.

    function action(currentState, formData) {  // ...  return 'next state';}

#### Display information after submitting a form[](#display-information-after-submitting-a-form "Link for Display information after submitting a form")

1. Display form errors 2. Display structured information after submitting a form

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

Display form errors[](#display-form-errors "Link for this heading")

To display messages such as an error message or toast that’s returned by a Server Function, wrap the action in a call to `useActionState`.

---------------------------------------------------------------

### My action can no longer read the submitted form data[](#my-action-can-no-longer-read-the-submitted-form-data "Link for My action can no longer read the submitted form data ")

When you wrap an action with `useActionState`, it gets an extra argument _as its first argument_. The submitted form data is therefore its _second_ argument instead of its first as it would usually be. The new first argument that gets added is the current state of the form.

    function action(currentState, formData) {  // ...}

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useCallback(fn, dependencies)`[](#usecallback "Link for this heading")

Call `useCallback` at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:

    import { useCallback } from 'react';export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails,    });  }, [productId, referrer]);

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `fn`: The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the `dependencies` have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.
    
*   `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `fn` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison algorithm.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

On the initial render, `useCallback` returns the `fn` function you have passed.

During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored `fn` function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the `fn` function you have passed during this render.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useCallback` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
*   React **will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that.** For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should match your expectations if you rely on `useCallback` as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a [state variable](/reference/react/useState#im-trying-to-set-state-to-a-function-but-it-gets-called-instead) or a [ref](/reference/react/useRef#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents) may be more appropriate.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Skipping re-rendering of components[](#skipping-re-rendering-of-components "Link for Skipping re-rendering of components ")

When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components. Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful.

To cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the `useCallback` Hook:

    import { useCallback } from 'react';function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails,    });  }, [productId, referrer]);  // ...

You need to pass two things to `useCallback`:

1.  A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.
2.  A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function.

On the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from `useCallback` will be the function you passed.

On the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), `useCallback` will return the same function as before. Otherwise, `useCallback` will return the function you passed on _this_ render.

In other words, `useCallback` caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.

**Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

Say you’re passing a `handleSubmit` function down from the `ProductPage` to the `ShippingForm` component:

    function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {  // ...  return (    <div className={theme}>      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />    </div>  );

You’ve noticed that toggling the `theme` prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove `<ShippingForm />` from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the `ShippingForm` component.

**By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively.** This is why, when `ProductPage` re-renders with a different `theme`, the `ShippingForm` component _also_ re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell `ShippingForm` to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in [`memo`:](/reference/react/memo)

    import { memo } from 'react';const ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) {  // ...});

**With this change, `ShippingForm` will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the _same_ as on the last render.** This is when caching a function becomes important! Let’s say you defined `handleSubmit` without `useCallback`:

    function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different function...  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails,    });  }    return (    <div className={theme}>      {/* ... so ShippingForm's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />    </div>  );}

**In JavaScript, a `function () {}` or `() => {}` always creates a _different_ function,** similar to how the `{}` object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that `ShippingForm` props will never be the same, and your [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) optimization won’t work. This is where `useCallback` comes in handy:

    function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {  // Tell React to cache your function between re-renders...  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails,    });  }, [productId, referrer]); // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...  return (    <div className={theme}>      {/* ...ShippingForm will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />    </div>  );}

**By wrapping `handleSubmit` in `useCallback`, you ensure that it’s the _same_ function between the re-renders** (until dependencies change). You don’t _have to_ wrap a function in `useCallback` unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in [`memo`,](/reference/react/memo) and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are other reasons you might need `useCallback` which are described further on this page.

### Note

**You should only rely on `useCallback` as a performance optimization.** If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add `useCallback` back.

##### Deep Dive

#### How is useCallback related to useMemo?[](#how-is-usecallback-related-to-usememo "Link for How is useCallback related to useMemo? ")

Show Details

You will often see [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) alongside `useCallback`. They are both useful when you’re trying to optimize a child component. They let you [memoize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) (or, in other words, cache) something you’re passing down:

    import { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {  const product = useData('/product/' + productId);  const requirements = useMemo(() => { // Calls your function and caches its result    return computeRequirements(product);  }, [product]);  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { // Caches your function itself    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails,    });  }, [productId, referrer]);  return (    <div className={theme}>      <ShippingForm requirements={requirements} onSubmit={handleSubmit} />    </div>  );}

The difference is in _what_ they’re letting you cache:

*   **[`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) caches the _result_ of calling your function.** In this example, it caches the result of calling `computeRequirements(product)` so that it doesn’t change unless `product` has changed. This lets you pass the `requirements` object down without unnecessarily re-rendering `ShippingForm`. When necessary, React will call the function you’ve passed during rendering to calculate the result.
*   **`useCallback` caches _the function itself._** Unlike `useMemo`, it does not call the function you provide. Instead, it caches the function you provided so that `handleSubmit` _itself_ doesn’t change unless `productId` or `referrer` has changed. This lets you pass the `handleSubmit` function down without unnecessarily re-rendering `ShippingForm`. Your code won’t run until the user submits the form.

If you’re already familiar with [`useMemo`,](/reference/react/useMemo) you might find it helpful to think of `useCallback` as this:

    // Simplified implementation (inside React)function useCallback(fn, dependencies) {  return useMemo(() => fn, dependencies);}

[Read more about the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`.](/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-function)

##### Deep Dive

#### Should you add useCallback everywhere?[](#should-you-add-usecallback-everywhere "Link for Should you add useCallback everywhere? ")

Show Details

If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.

Caching a function with `useCallback` is only valuable in a few cases:

*   You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn’t changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only if dependencies changed.
*   The function you’re passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, another function wrapped in `useCallback` depends on it, or you depend on this function from [`useEffect.`](/reference/react/useEffect)

There is no benefit to wrapping a function in `useCallback` in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component.

Note that `useCallback` does not prevent _creating_ the function. You’re always creating a function (and that’s fine!), but React ignores it and gives you back a cached function if nothing changed.

**In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:**

1.  When a component visually wraps other components, let it [accept JSX as children.](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) Then, if the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don’t need to re-render.
2.  Prefer local state and don’t [lift state up](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) any further than necessary. Don’t keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library.
3.  Keep your [rendering logic pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it’s a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization.
4.  Avoid [unnecessary Effects that update state.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.
5.  Try to [remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) For example, instead of memoization, it’s often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component.

If a specific interaction still feels laggy, [use the React Developer Tools profiler](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) to see which components benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In long term, we’re researching [doing memoization automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc) to solve this once and for all.

#### The difference between useCallback and declaring a function directly[](#examples-rerendering "Link for The difference between useCallback and declaring a function directly")

1. Skipping re-rendering with `useCallback` and `memo` 2. Always re-rendering a component

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

Skipping re-rendering with `useCallback` and `memo`[](#skipping-re-rendering-with-usecallback-and-memo "Link for this heading")

In this example, the `ShippingForm` component is **artificially slowed down** so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme.

Incrementing the counter feels slow because it forces the slowed down `ShippingForm` to re-render. That’s expected because the counter has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.

Next, try toggling the theme. **Thanks to `useCallback` together with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo), it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown!** `ShippingForm` skipped re-rendering because the `handleSubmit` function has not changed. The `handleSubmit` function has not changed because both `productId` and `referrer` (your `useCallback` dependencies) haven’t changed since last render.

### Updating state from a memoized callback[](#updating-state-from-a-memoized-callback "Link for Updating state from a memoized callback ")

Sometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.

This `handleAddTodo` function specifies `todos` as a dependency because it computes the next todos from it:

    function TodoList() {  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);  }, [todos]);  // ...

You’ll usually want memoized functions to have as few dependencies as possible. When you read some state only to calculate the next state, you can remove that dependency by passing an [updater function](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) instead:

    function TodoList() {  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };    setTodos(todos => [...todos, newTodo]);  }, []); // ✅ No need for the todos dependency  // ...

Here, instead of making `todos` a dependency and reading it inside, you pass an instruction about _how_ to update the state (`todos => [...todos, newTodo]`) to React. [Read more about updater functions.](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state)

* * *

### Preventing an Effect from firing too often[](#preventing-an-effect-from-firing-too-often "Link for Preventing an Effect from firing too often ")

Sometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an [Effect:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  function createOptions() {    return {      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',      roomId: roomId    };  }  useEffect(() => {    const options = createOptions();    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    // ...

This creates a problem. [Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) However, if you declare `createOptions` as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:

      useEffect(() => {    const options = createOptions();    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [createOptions]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render  // ...

To solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into `useCallback`:

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  const createOptions = useCallback(() => {    return {      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',      roomId: roomId    };  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes  useEffect(() => {    const options = createOptions();    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [createOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when createOptions changes  // ...

This ensures that the `createOptions` function is the same between re-renders if the `roomId` is the same. **However, it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency.** Move your function _inside_ the Effect:

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  useEffect(() => {    function createOptions() { // ✅ No need for useCallback or function dependencies!      return {        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',        roomId: roomId      };    }    const options = createOptions();    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes  // ...

Now your code is simpler and doesn’t need `useCallback`. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)

### Optimizing a custom Hook[](#optimizing-a-custom-hook "Link for Optimizing a custom Hook ")

If you’re writing a [custom Hook,](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into `useCallback`:

    function useRouter() {  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });  }, [dispatch]);  const goBack = useCallback(() => {    dispatch({ type: 'back' });  }, [dispatch]);  return {    navigate,    goBack,  };}

This ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Every time my component renders, `useCallback` returns a different function[](#every-time-my-component-renders-usecallback-returns-a-different-function "Link for this heading")

Make sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!

If you forget the dependency array, `useCallback` will return a new function every time:

    function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails,    });  }); // 🔴 Returns a new function every time: no dependency array  // ...

This is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:

    function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails,    });  }, [productId, referrer]); // ✅ Does not return a new function unnecessarily  // ...

If this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:

      const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {    // ..  }, [productId, referrer]);  console.log([productId, referrer]);

You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as `temp1` and the second one got saved as `temp2`, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:

    Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...

When you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or [memoize it as well.](/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook)

### I need to call `useCallback` for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed[](#i-need-to-call-usememo-for-each-list-item-in-a-loop-but-its-not-allowed "Link for this heading")

Suppose the `Chart` component is wrapped in [`memo`](/reference/react/memo). You want to skip re-rendering every `Chart` in the list when the `ReportList` component re-renders. However, you can’t call `useCallback` in a loop:

    function ReportList({ items }) {  return (    <article>      {items.map(item => {        // 🔴 You can't call useCallback in a loop like this:        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {          sendReport(item)        }, [item]);        return (          <figure key={item.id}>            <Chart onClick={handleClick} />          </figure>        );      })}    </article>  );}

Instead, extract a component for an individual item, and put `useCallback` there:

    function ReportList({ items }) {  return (    <article>      {items.map(item =>        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />      )}    </article>  );}function Report({ item }) {  // ✅ Call useCallback at the top level:  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {    sendReport(item)  }, [item]);  return (    <figure>      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />    </figure>  );}

Alternatively, you could remove `useCallback` in the last snippet and instead wrap `Report` itself in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) If the `item` prop does not change, `Report` will skip re-rendering, so `Chart` will skip re-rendering too:

    function ReportList({ items }) {  // ...}const Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {  function handleClick() {    sendReport(item);  }  return (    <figure>      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />    </figure>  );});

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useContext(SomeContext)`[](#usecontext "Link for this heading")

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

    import { useContext } from 'react';function MyComponent() {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  // ...

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `SomeContext`: The context that you’ve previously created with [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext). The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useContext` returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the `value` passed to the closest `SomeContext.Provider` above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the `defaultValue` you have passed to [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext) for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useContext()` call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the _same_ component. The corresponding `<Context.Provider>` **needs to be _above_** the component doing the `useContext()` call.
*   React **automatically re-renders** all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different `value`. The previous and the next values are compared with the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. Skipping re-renders with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.
*   If your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if `SomeContext` that you use to provide context and `SomeContext` that you use to read it are **_exactly_ the same object**, as determined by a `===` comparison.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Passing data deeply into the tree[](#passing-data-deeply-into-the-tree "Link for Passing data deeply into the tree ")

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

    import { useContext } from 'react';function Button() {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  // ...

`useContext` returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds **the closest context provider above** for that particular context.

To pass context to a `Button`, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider:

    function MyPage() {  return (    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">      <Form />    </ThemeContext.Provider>  );}function Form() {  // ... renders buttons inside ...}

It doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the `Button`. When a `Button` _anywhere_ inside of `Form` calls `useContext(ThemeContext)`, it will receive `"dark"` as the value.

### Pitfall

`useContext()` always looks for the closest provider _above_ the component that calls it. It searches upwards and **does not** consider providers in the component from which you’re calling `useContext()`.

### Updating data passed via context[](#updating-data-passed-via-context "Link for Updating data passed via context ")

Often, you’ll want the context to change over time. To update context, combine it with [state.](/reference/react/useState) Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the context value to the provider.

    function MyPage() {  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');  return (    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>      <Form />      <Button onClick={() => {        setTheme('light');      }}>        Switch to light theme      </Button>    </ThemeContext.Provider>  );}

Now any `Button` inside of the provider will receive the current `theme` value. If you call `setTheme` to update the `theme` value that you pass to the provider, all `Button` components will re-render with the new `'light'` value.

#### Examples of updating context[](#examples-basic "Link for Examples of updating context")

1. Updating a value via context 2. Updating an object via context 3. Multiple contexts 4. Extracting providers to a component 5. Scaling up with context and a reducer

#### 

Example 1 of 5:

Updating a value via context[](#updating-a-value-via-context "Link for this heading")

In this example, the `MyApp` component holds a state variable which is then passed to the `ThemeContext` provider. Checking the “Dark mode” checkbox updates the state. Changing the provided value re-renders all the components using that context.

App.js

App.js

import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

            setTheme(e.target.checked ? 'dark' : 'light')
          }}
        />
        Use dark mode
      </label\>
    </ThemeContext.Provider\>
  )
}

function Form({ children }) {
  return (
    <Panel title\="Welcome"\>
      <Button\>Sign up</Button\>
      <Button\>Log in</Button\>
    </Panel\>
  );

Note that `value="dark"` passes the `"dark"` string, but `value={theme}` passes the value of the JavaScript `theme` variable with [JSX curly braces.](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces) Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings.

### Specifying a fallback default value[](#specifying-a-fallback-default-value "Link for Specifying a fallback default value ")

If React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by `useContext()` will be equal to the default value that you specified when you [created that context](/reference/react/createContext):

    const ThemeContext = createContext(null);

The default value **never changes**. If you want to update context, use it with state as [described above.](#updating-data-passed-via-context)

Often, instead of `null`, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:

    const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

This way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.

In the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s **outside any theme context provider** and the default context theme value is `'light'`. Try editing the default theme to be `'dark'`.

### Overriding context for a part of the tree[](#overriding-context-for-a-part-of-the-tree "Link for Overriding context for a part of the tree ")

### Optimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions[](#optimizing-re-renders-when-passing-objects-and-functions "Link for Optimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions ")

You can pass any values via context, including objects and functions.

    function MyApp() {  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);  function login(response) {    storeCredentials(response.credentials);    setCurrentUser(response.user);  }  return (    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ currentUser, login }}>      <Page />    </AuthContext.Provider>  );}

Here, the context value is a JavaScript object with two properties, one of which is a function. Whenever `MyApp` re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a _different_ object pointing at a _different_ function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call `useContext(AuthContext)`.

In smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like `currentUser`, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the `login` function with [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) and wrap the object creation into [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo). This is a performance optimization:

    import { useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';function MyApp() {  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);  const login = useCallback((response) => {    storeCredentials(response.credentials);    setCurrentUser(response.user);  }, []);  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({    currentUser,    login  }), [currentUser, login]);  return (    <AuthContext.Provider value={contextValue}>      <Page />    </AuthContext.Provider>  );}

As a result of this change, even if `MyApp` needs to re-render, the components calling `useContext(AuthContext)` won’t need to re-render unless `currentUser` has changed.

There are a few common ways that this can happen:

1.  You’re rendering `<SomeContext.Provider>` in the same component (or below) as where you’re calling `useContext()`. Move `<SomeContext.Provider>` _above and outside_ the component calling `useContext()`.
2.  You may have forgotten to wrap your component with `<SomeContext.Provider>`, or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using [React DevTools.](/learn/react-developer-tools)
3.  You might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes `SomeContext` as seen from the providing component and `SomeContext` as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like `window.SomeContext1` and `window.SomeContext2` and then checking whether `window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2` in the console. If they’re not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level.

### I am always getting `undefined` from my context although the default value is different[](#i-am-always-getting-undefined-from-my-context-although-the-default-value-is-different "Link for this heading")

You might have a provider without a `value` in the tree:

    // 🚩 Doesn't work: no value prop<ThemeContext.Provider>   <Button /></ThemeContext.Provider>

If you forget to specify `value`, it’s like passing `value={undefined}`.

You may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:

    // 🚩 Doesn't work: prop should be called "value"<ThemeContext.Provider theme={theme}>   <Button /></ThemeContext.Provider>

In both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop `value`:

    // ✅ Passing the value prop<ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>   <Button /></ThemeContext.Provider>

Note that the [default value from your `createContext(defaultValue)` call](#specifying-a-fallback-default-value) is only used **if there is no matching provider above at all.** If there is a `<SomeContext.Provider value={undefined}>` component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling `useContext(SomeContext)` _will_ receive `undefined` as the context value.

### `useDebugValue(value, format?)`[](#usedebugvalue "Link for this heading")

Call `useDebugValue` at the top level of your [custom Hook](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) to display a readable debug value:

    import { useDebugValue } from 'react';function useOnlineStatus() {  // ...  useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');  // ...}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `value`: The value you want to display in React DevTools. It can have any type.
*   **optional** `format`: A formatting function. When the component is inspected, React DevTools will call the formatting function with the `value` as the argument, and then display the returned formatted value (which may have any type). If you don’t specify the formatting function, the original `value` itself will be displayed.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useDebugValue` does not return anything.

### Adding a label to a custom Hook[](#adding-a-label-to-a-custom-hook "Link for Adding a label to a custom Hook ")

    import { useDebugValue } from 'react';function useOnlineStatus() {  // ...  useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');  // ...}

This gives components calling `useOnlineStatus` a label like `OnlineStatus: "Online"` when you inspect them:

Without the `useDebugValue` call, only the underlying data (in this example, `true`) would be displayed.

### Note

Don’t add debug values to every custom Hook. It’s most valuable for custom Hooks that are part of shared libraries and that have a complex internal data structure that’s difficult to inspect.

* * *

### Deferring formatting of a debug value[](#deferring-formatting-of-a-debug-value "Link for Deferring formatting of a debug value ")

You can also pass a formatting function as the second argument to `useDebugValue`:

    useDebugValue(date, date => date.toDateString());

Your formatting function will receive the debug value as a parameter and should return a formatted display value. When your component is inspected, React DevTools will call this function and display its result.

This lets you avoid running potentially expensive formatting logic unless the component is actually inspected. For example, if `date` is a Date value, this avoids calling `toDateString()` on it for every render.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useDeferredValue(value, initialValue?)`[](#usedeferredvalue "Link for this heading")

Call `useDeferredValue` at the top level of your component to get a deferred version of that value.

    import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';function SearchPage() {  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);  // ...}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `value`: The value you want to defer. It can have any type.
*   **optional** `initialValue`: A value to use during the initial render of a component. If this option is omitted, `useDeferredValue` will not defer during the initial render, because there’s no previous version of `value` that it can render instead.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

*   `currentValue`: During the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the `initialValue`, or the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so it will return the old value), and then try another re-render in the background with the new value (so it will return the updated value).

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   When an update is inside a Transition, `useDeferredValue` always returns the new `value` and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred.
    
*   The values you pass to `useDeferredValue` should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to `useDeferredValue`, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.
    
*   When `useDeferredValue` receives a different value (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the `value`, React will restart the background re-render from scratch. For example, if the user is typing into an input faster than a chart receiving its deferred value can re-render, the chart will only re-render after the user stops typing.
    
*   `useDeferredValue` is integrated with [`<Suspense>`.](/reference/react/Suspense) If the background update caused by a new value suspends the UI, the user will not see the fallback. They will see the old deferred value until the data loads.
    
*   `useDeferredValue` does not by itself prevent extra network requests.
    
*   There is no fixed delay caused by `useDeferredValue` itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value. Any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it.
    
*   The background re-render caused by `useDeferredValue` does not fire Effects until it’s committed to the screen. If the background re-render suspends, its Effects will run after the data loads and the UI updates.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Showing stale content while fresh content is loading[](#showing-stale-content-while-fresh-content-is-loading "Link for Showing stale content while fresh content is loading ")

Call `useDeferredValue` at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI.

    import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';function SearchPage() {  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);  // ...}

During the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided.

During updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value. In particular, React will first re-render _without_ updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in the background.

**Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

### Note

This example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:

*   Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data#with-suspense)
*   Lazy-loading component code with [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy)
*   Reading the value of a Promise with [`use`](/reference/react/use)

[Learn more about Suspense and its limitations.](/reference/react/Suspense)

In this example, the `SearchResults` component [suspends](/reference/react/Suspense#displaying-a-fallback-while-content-is-loading) while fetching the search results. Try typing `"a"`, waiting for the results, and then editing it to `"ab"`. The results for `"a"` get replaced by the loading fallback.

App.jsSearchResults.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Suspense, useState } from 'react';
import SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';

export default function App() {
  const \[query, setQuery\] = useState('');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Search albums:
        <input value\={query} onChange\={e \=> setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Suspense fallback\={<h2\>Loading...</h2\>}\>
        <SearchResults query\={query} />
      </Suspense\>
    </\>
  );
}

Show more

A common alternative UI pattern is to _defer_ updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call `useDeferredValue` to pass a deferred version of the query down:

    export default function App() {  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);  return (    <>      <label>        Search albums:        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />      </label>      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />      </Suspense>    </>  );}

The `query` will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the `deferredQuery` will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so `SearchResults` will show the stale results for a bit.

Enter `"a"` in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to `"ab"`. Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded:

App.jsSearchResults.js

App.js

export default function App() {
  const \[query, setQuery\] = useState('');
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Search albums:
        <input value\={query} onChange\={e \=> setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Suspense fallback\={<h2\>Loading...</h2\>}\>
        <SearchResults query\={deferredQuery} />
      </Suspense\>
    </\>

##### Deep Dive

#### How does deferring a value work under the hood?[](#how-does-deferring-a-value-work-under-the-hood "Link for How does deferring a value work under the hood? ")

Show Details

You can think of it as happening in two steps:

1.  **First, React re-renders with the new `query` (`"ab"`) but with the old `deferredQuery` (still `"a")`.** The `deferredQuery` value, which you pass to the result list, is _deferred:_ it “lags behind” the `query` value.
    
2.  **In the background, React tries to re-render with _both_ `query` and `deferredQuery` updated to `"ab"`.** If this re-render completes, React will show it on the screen. However, if it suspends (the results for `"ab"` have not loaded yet), React will abandon this rendering attempt, and retry this re-render again after the data has loaded. The user will keep seeing the stale deferred value until the data is ready.
    

The deferred “background” rendering is interruptible. For example, if you type into the input again, React will abandon it and restart with the new value. React will always use the latest provided value.

Note that there is still a network request per each keystroke. What’s being deferred here is displaying results (until they’re ready), not the network requests themselves. Even if the user continues typing, responses for each keystroke get cached, so pressing Backspace is instant and doesn’t fetch again.

* * *

### Indicating that the content is stale[](#indicating-that-the-content-is-stale "Link for Indicating that the content is stale ")

In the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:

    <div style={{  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1,}}>  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} /></div>

With this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below:

App.jsSearchResults.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function App() {
  const \[query, setQuery\] = useState('');
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Search albums:
        <input value\={query} onChange\={e \=> setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Suspense fallback\={<h2\>Loading...</h2\>}\>
        <div style\={{
          opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1,
          transition: isStale ? 'opacity 0.2s 0.2s linear' : 'opacity 0s 0s linear'
        }}\>
          <SearchResults query\={deferredQuery} />
        </div\>
      </Suspense\>
    </\>
  );

### Deferring re-rendering for a part of the UI[](#deferring-re-rendering-for-a-part-of-the-ui "Link for Deferring re-rendering for a part of the UI ")

You can also apply `useDeferredValue` as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI.

Imagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke:

    function App() {  const [text, setText] = useState('');  return (    <>      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />      <SlowList text={text} />    </>  );}

First, optimize `SlowList` to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this, [wrap it in `memo`:](/reference/react/memo#skipping-re-rendering-when-props-are-unchanged)

    const SlowList = memo(function SlowList({ text }) {  // ...});

However, this only helps if the `SlowList` props are _the same_ as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re _different,_ and when you actually need to show different visual output.

Concretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the `SlowList` receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, `useDeferredValue` lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower):

    function App() {  const [text, setText] = useState('');  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);  return (    <>      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />      <SlowList text={deferredText} />    </>  );}

This does not make re-rendering of the `SlowList` faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing.

#### The difference between useDeferredValue and unoptimized re-rendering[](#examples "Link for The difference between useDeferredValue and unoptimized re-rendering")

1. Deferred re-rendering of the list 2. Unoptimized re-rendering of the list

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

Deferred re-rendering of the list[](#deferred-re-rendering-of-the-list "Link for this heading")

In this example, each item in the `SlowList` component is **artificially slowed down** so that you can see how `useDeferredValue` lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it.

App.jsSlowList.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';
import SlowList from './SlowList.js';

export default function App() {
  const \[text, setText\] = useState('');
  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);
  return (
    <\>
      <input value\={text} onChange\={e \=> setText(e.target.value)} />
      <SlowList text\={deferredText} />
    </\>
  );
}

Next Example

### Pitfall

This optimization requires `SlowList` to be wrapped in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) This is because whenever the `text` changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, `deferredText` still has its previous value, so `SlowList` is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without [`memo`,](/reference/react/memo) it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization.

##### Deep Dive

#### How is deferring a value different from debouncing and throttling?[](#how-is-deferring-a-value-different-from-debouncing-and-throttling "Link for How is deferring a value different from debouncing and throttling? ")

Show Details

There are two common optimization techniques you might have used before in this scenario:

*   _Debouncing_ means you’d wait for the user to stop typing (e.g. for a second) before updating the list.
*   _Throttling_ means you’d update the list every once in a while (e.g. at most once a second).

While these techniques are helpful in some cases, `useDeferredValue` is better suited to optimizing rendering because it is deeply integrated with React itself and adapts to the user’s device.

Unlike debouncing or throttling, it doesn’t require choosing any fixed delay. If the user’s device is fast (e.g. powerful laptop), the deferred re-render would happen almost immediately and wouldn’t be noticeable. If the user’s device is slow, the list would “lag behind” the input proportionally to how slow the device is.

Also, unlike with debouncing or throttling, deferred re-renders done by `useDeferredValue` are interruptible by default. This means that if React is in the middle of re-rendering a large list, but the user makes another keystroke, React will abandon that re-render, handle the keystroke, and then start rendering in the background again. By contrast, debouncing and throttling still produce a janky experience because they’re _blocking:_ they merely postpone the moment when rendering blocks the keystroke.

If the work you’re optimizing doesn’t happen during rendering, debouncing and throttling are still useful. For example, they can let you fire fewer network requests. You can also use these techniques together.

### `useEffect(setup, dependencies?)`[](#useeffect "Link for this heading")

Call `useEffect` at the top level of your component to declare an Effect:

    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import { createConnection } from './chat.js';function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => {      connection.disconnect();    };  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);  // ...}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `setup`: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a _cleanup_ function. When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.
    
*   **optional** `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `setup` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component. [See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all.](#examples-dependencies)
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useEffect` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useEffect` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
    
*   If you’re **not trying to synchronize with some external system,** [you probably don’t need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)
    
*   When Strict Mode is on, React will **run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle** before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, [implement the cleanup function.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)
    
*   If some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will **cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed.** To fix this, remove unnecessary [object](#removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies) and [function](#removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies) dependencies. You can also [extract state updates](#updating-state-based-on-previous-state-from-an-effect) and [non-reactive logic](#reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect) outside of your Effect.
    
*   If your Effect wasn’t caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser **paint the updated screen first before running your Effect.** If your Effect is doing something visual (for example, positioning a tooltip), and the delay is noticeable (for example, it flickers), replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`.](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect)
    
*   If your Effect is caused by an interaction (like a click), **React may run your Effect before the browser paints the updated screen**. This ensures that the result of the Effect can be observed by the event system. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must defer the work until after paint, such as an `alert()`, you can use `setTimeout`. See [reactwg/react-18/128](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/128) for more information.
    
*   Even if your Effect was caused by an interaction (like a click), **React may allow the browser to repaint the screen before processing the state updates inside your Effect.** Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must block the browser from repainting the screen, you need to replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`.](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect)
    
*   Effects **only run on the client.** They don’t run during server rendering.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Connecting to an external system[](#connecting-to-an-external-system "Link for Connecting to an external system ")

Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called _external._

To [connect your component to some external system,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) call `useEffect` at the top level of your component:

    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import { createConnection } from './chat.js';function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  useEffect(() => {  	const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();  	return () => {      connection.disconnect();  	};  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);  // ...}

You need to pass two arguments to `useEffect`:

1.  A _setup function_ with setup code that connects to that system.
    *   It should return a _cleanup function_ with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.
2.  A list of dependencies including every value from your component used inside of those functions.

**React calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it’s necessary, which may happen multiple times:**

1.  Your setup code runs when your component is added to the page _(mounts)_.
2.  After every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:
    *   First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.
    *   Then, your setup code runs with the new props and state.
3.  Your cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page _(unmounts)._

**Let’s illustrate this sequence for the example above.**

When the `ChatRoom` component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial `serverUrl` and `roomId`. If either `serverUrl` or `roomId` change as a result of a re-render (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will _disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one._ When the `ChatRoom` component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time.

**To [help you find bugs,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the setup.** This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a _setup_ → _cleanup_ → _setup_ sequence (as in development). [See common solutions.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

**Try to [write every Effect as an independent process](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process) and [think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#thinking-from-the-effects-perspective)** It shouldn’t matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly “mirrors” the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.

### Note

An Effect lets you [keep your component synchronized](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with some external system (like a chat service). Here, _external system_ means any piece of code that’s not controlled by React, such as:

*   A timer managed with [`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) and [`clearInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval).
*   An event subscription using [`window.addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) and [`window.removeEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener).
*   A third-party animation library with an API like `animation.start()` and `animation.reset()`.

**If you’re not connecting to any external system, [you probably don’t need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)**

#### Examples of connecting to an external system[](#examples-connecting "Link for Examples of connecting to an external system")

1. Connecting to a chat server 2. Listening to a global browser event 3. Triggering an animation 4. Controlling a modal dialog 5. Tracking element visibility

#### 

Example 1 of 5:

Connecting to a chat server[](#connecting-to-a-chat-server "Link for this heading")

In this example, the `ChatRoom` component uses an Effect to stay connected to an external system defined in `chat.js`. Press “Open chat” to make the `ChatRoom` component appear. This sandbox runs in development mode, so there is an extra connect-and-disconnect cycle, as [explained here.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) Try changing the `roomId` and `serverUrl` using the dropdown and the input, and see how the Effect re-connects to the chat. Press “Close chat” to see the Effect disconnect one last time.

### Wrapping Effects in custom Hooks[](#wrapping-effects-in-custom-hooks "Link for Wrapping Effects in custom Hooks ")

Effects are an [“escape hatch”:](/learn/escape-hatches) you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. If you find yourself often needing to manually write Effects, it’s usually a sign that you need to extract some [custom Hooks](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) for common behaviors your components rely on.

For example, this `useChatRoom` custom Hook “hides” the logic of your Effect behind a more declarative API:

    function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {  useEffect(() => {    const options = {      serverUrl: serverUrl,      roomId: roomId    };    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);}

Then you can use it from any component like this:

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  useChatRoom({    roomId: roomId,    serverUrl: serverUrl  });  // ...

There are also many excellent custom Hooks for every purpose available in the React ecosystem.

### Controlling a non-React widget[](#controlling-a-non-react-widget "Link for Controlling a non-React widget ")

Sometimes, you want to keep an external system synchronized to some prop or state of your component.

For example, if you have a third-party map widget or a video player component written without React, you can use an Effect to call methods on it that make its state match the current state of your React component. This Effect creates an instance of a `MapWidget` class defined in `map-widget.js`. When you change the `zoomLevel` prop of the `Map` component, the Effect calls the `setZoom()` on the class instance to keep it synchronized:

App.jsMap.jsmap-widget.js

Map.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { MapWidget } from './map-widget.js';

export default function Map({ zoomLevel }) {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  const mapRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() \=> {
    if (mapRef.current === null) {
      mapRef.current = new MapWidget(containerRef.current);
    }

    const map = mapRef.current;
    map.setZoom(zoomLevel);
  }, \[zoomLevel\]);

  return (
    <div
      style\={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
      ref\={containerRef}
    />
  );
}

Show more

In this example, a cleanup function is not needed because the `MapWidget` class manages only the DOM node that was passed to it. After the `Map` React component is removed from the tree, both the DOM node and the `MapWidget` class instance will be automatically garbage-collected by the browser JavaScript engine.

### Fetching data with Effects[](#fetching-data-with-effects "Link for Fetching data with Effects ")

You can use an Effect to fetch data for your component. Note that [if you use a framework,](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks) using your framework’s data fetching mechanism will be a lot more efficient than writing Effects manually.

If you want to fetch data from an Effect manually, your code might look like this:

    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import { fetchBio } from './api.js';export default function Page() {  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);  useEffect(() => {    let ignore = false;    setBio(null);    fetchBio(person).then(result => {      if (!ignore) {        setBio(result);      }    });    return () => {      ignore = true;    };  }, [person]);  // ...

Note the `ignore` variable which is initialized to `false`, and is set to `true` during cleanup. This ensures [your code doesn’t suffer from “race conditions”:](https://maxrozen.com/race-conditions-fetching-data-react-with-useeffect) network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.

  const \[person, setPerson\] = useState('Alice');
  const \[bio, setBio\] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() \=> {
    let ignore = false;
    setBio(null);
    fetchBio(person).then(result \=> {
      if (!ignore) {
        setBio(result);
      }
    });
    return () \=> {
      ignore = true;
    }
  }, \[person\]);

  return (
    <\>
      <select value\={person} onChange\={e \=> {
        setPerson(e.target.value);
      }}\>
        <option value\="Alice"\>Alice</option\>
        <option value\="Bob"\>Bob</option\>
        <option value\="Taylor"\>Taylor</option\>

      <hr />
      <p\><i\>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i\></p\>

You can also rewrite using the [`async` / `await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) syntax, but you still need to provide a cleanup function:

Writing data fetching directly in Effects gets repetitive and makes it difficult to add optimizations like caching and server rendering later. [It’s easier to use a custom Hook—either your own or maintained by the community.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#when-to-use-custom-hooks)

##### Deep Dive

#### What are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects?[](#what-are-good-alternatives-to-data-fetching-in-effects "Link for What are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? ")

Show Details

Writing `fetch` calls inside Effects is a [popular way to fetch data](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/), especially in fully client-side apps. This is, however, a very manual approach and it has significant downsides:

*   **Effects don’t run on the server.** This means that the initial server-rendered HTML will only include a loading state with no data. The client computer will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient.
*   **Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create “network waterfalls”.** You render the parent component, it fetches some data, renders the child components, and then they start fetching their data. If the network is not very fast, this is significantly slower than fetching all data in parallel.
*   **Fetching directly in Effects usually means you don’t preload or cache data.** For example, if the component unmounts and then mounts again, it would have to fetch the data again.
*   **It’s not very ergonomic.** There’s quite a bit of boilerplate code involved when writing `fetch` calls in a way that doesn’t suffer from bugs like [race conditions.](https://maxrozen.com/race-conditions-fetching-data-react-with-useeffect)

This list of downsides is not specific to React. It applies to fetching data on mount with any library. Like with routing, data fetching is not trivial to do well, so we recommend the following approaches:

*   **If you use a [framework](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks), use its built-in data fetching mechanism.** Modern React frameworks have integrated data fetching mechanisms that are efficient and don’t suffer from the above pitfalls.
*   **Otherwise, consider using or building a client-side cache.** Popular open source solutions include [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/), [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), and [React Router 6.4+.](https://beta.reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) You can build your own solution too, in which case you would use Effects under the hood but also add logic for deduplicating requests, caching responses, and avoiding network waterfalls (by preloading data or hoisting data requirements to routes).

You can continue fetching data directly in Effects if neither of these approaches suit you.

* * *

### Specifying reactive dependencies[](#specifying-reactive-dependencies "Link for Specifying reactive dependencies ")

**Notice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect.** Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect’s dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // This is a reactive value too  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads these reactive values    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify them as dependencies of your Effect  // ...}

If either `serverUrl` or `roomId` change, your Effect will reconnect to the chat using the new values.

**[Reactive values](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component.** Since `roomId` and `serverUrl` are reactive values, you can’t remove them from the dependencies. If you try to omit them and [your linter is correctly configured for React,](/learn/editor-setup#linting) the linter will flag this as a mistake you need to fix:

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');    useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'roomId' and 'serverUrl'  // ...}

**To remove a dependency, you need to [“prove” to the linter that it _doesn’t need_ to be a dependency.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#removing-unnecessary-dependencies)** For example, you can move `serverUrl` out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders:

    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymorefunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared  // ...}

Now that `serverUrl` is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency. **If your Effect’s code doesn’t use any reactive values, its dependency list should be empty (`[]`):**

    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymoreconst roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymorefunction ChatRoom() {  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared  // ...}

[An Effect with empty dependencies](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means) doesn’t re-run when any of your component’s props or state change.

### Pitfall

If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:

    useEffect(() => {  // ...  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps}, []);

**When dependencies don’t match the code, there is a high risk of introducing bugs.** By suppressing the linter, you “lie” to React about the values your Effect depends on. [Instead, prove they’re unnecessary.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#removing-unnecessary-dependencies)

#### Examples of passing reactive dependencies[](#examples-dependencies "Link for Examples of passing reactive dependencies")

1. Passing a dependency array 2. Passing an empty dependency array 3. Passing no dependency array at all

#### 

Example 1 of 3:

Passing a dependency array[](#passing-a-dependency-array "Link for this heading")

If you specify the dependencies, your Effect runs **after the initial render _and_ after re-renders with changed dependencies.**

    useEffect(() => {  // ...}, [a, b]); // Runs again if a or b are different

In the below example, `serverUrl` and `roomId` are [reactive values,](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) so they both must be specified as dependencies. As a result, selecting a different room in the dropdown or editing the server URL input causes the chat to re-connect. However, since `message` isn’t used in the Effect (and so it isn’t a dependency), editing the message doesn’t re-connect to the chat.

    function Counter() {  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  useEffect(() => {    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {      setCount(count + 1); // You want to increment the counter every second...    }, 1000)    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);  }, [count]); // 🚩 ... but specifying `count` as a dependency always resets the interval.  // ...}

Since `count` is a reactive value, it must be specified in the list of dependencies. However, that causes the Effect to cleanup and setup again every time the `count` changes. This is not ideal.

To fix this, [pass the `c => c + 1` state updater](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) to `setCount`:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const \[count, setCount\] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() \=> {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() \=> {
      setCount(c \=> c + 1); // ✅ Pass a state updater
    }, 1000);
    return () \=> clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, \[\]); // ✅ Now count is not a dependency

  return <h1\>{count}</h1\>;
}

Now that you’re passing `c => c + 1` instead of `count + 1`, [your Effect no longer needs to depend on `count`.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#are-you-reading-some-state-to-calculate-the-next-state) As a result of this fix, it won’t need to cleanup and setup the interval again every time the `count` changes.

### Removing unnecessary object dependencies[](#removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies "Link for Removing unnecessary object dependencies ")

If your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the `options` object is [different for every render:](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#does-some-reactive-value-change-unintentionally)

    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  const options = { // 🚩 This object is created from scratch on every re-render    serverUrl: serverUrl,    roomId: roomId  };  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(options); // It's used inside the Effect    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [options]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render  // ...

Avoid using an object created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, create the object inside the Effect:

App.jschat.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const \[message, setMessage\] = useState('');

  useEffect(() \=> {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () \=> connection.disconnect();
  }, \[roomId\]);

  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1\>
      <input value\={message} onChange\={e \=> setMessage(e.target.value)} />
    </\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const \[roomId, setRoomId\] = useState('general');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value\={roomId}
          onChange\={e \=> setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        \>
          <option value\="general"\>general</option\>
          <option value\="travel"\>travel</option\>
          <option value\="music"\>music</option\>
        </select\>
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId\={roomId} />
    </\>
  );
}

Now that you create the `options` object inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the `roomId` string.

With this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike an object which gets re-created, a string like `roomId` doesn’t change unless you set it to another value. [Read more about removing dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

### Removing unnecessary function dependencies[](#removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies "Link for Removing unnecessary function dependencies ")

If your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the `createOptions` function is [different for every render:](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#does-some-reactive-value-change-unintentionally)

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  function createOptions() { // 🚩 This function is created from scratch on every re-render    return {      serverUrl: serverUrl,      roomId: roomId    };  }  useEffect(() => {    const options = createOptions(); // It's used inside the Effect    const connection = createConnection();    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [createOptions]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render  // ...

By itself, creating a function from scratch on every re-render is not a problem. You don’t need to optimize that. However, if you use it as a dependency of your Effect, it will cause your Effect to re-run after every re-render.

Avoid using a function created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, declare it inside the Effect:

### Reading the latest props and state from an Effect[](#reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect "Link for Reading the latest props and state from an Effect ")

### Under Construction

This section describes an **experimental API that has not yet been released** in a stable version of React.

By default, when you read a reactive value from an Effect, you have to add it as a dependency. This ensures that your Effect “reacts” to every change of that value. For most dependencies, that’s the behavior you want.

**However, sometimes you’ll want to read the _latest_ props and state from an Effect without “reacting” to them.** For example, imagine you want to log the number of the items in the shopping cart for every page visit:

    function Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {  useEffect(() => {    logVisit(url, shoppingCart.length);  }, [url, shoppingCart]); // ✅ All dependencies declared  // ...}

**What if you want to log a new page visit after every `url` change, but _not_ if only the `shoppingCart` changes?** You can’t exclude `shoppingCart` from dependencies without breaking the [reactivity rules.](#specifying-reactive-dependencies) However, you can express that you _don’t want_ a piece of code to “react” to changes even though it is called from inside an Effect. [Declare an _Effect Event_](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#declaring-an-effect-event) with the [`useEffectEvent`](/reference/react/experimental_useEffectEvent) Hook, and move the code reading `shoppingCart` inside of it:

    function Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {    logVisit(visitedUrl, shoppingCart.length)  });  useEffect(() => {    onVisit(url);  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared  // ...}

**Effect Events are not reactive and must always be omitted from dependencies of your Effect.** This is what lets you put non-reactive code (where you can read the latest value of some props and state) inside of them. By reading `shoppingCart` inside of `onVisit`, you ensure that `shoppingCart` won’t re-run your Effect.

[Read more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events)

### Displaying different content on the server and the client[](#displaying-different-content-on-the-server-and-the-client "Link for Displaying different content on the server and the client ")

If your app uses server rendering (either [directly](/reference/react-dom/server) or via a [framework](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks)), your component will render in two different environments. On the server, it will render to produce the initial HTML. On the client, React will run the rendering code again so that it can attach your event handlers to that HTML. This is why, for [hydration](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html) to work, your initial render output must be identical on the client and the server.

In rare cases, you might need to display different content on the client. For example, if your app reads some data from [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), it can’t possibly do that on the server. Here is how you could implement this:

    function MyComponent() {  const [didMount, setDidMount] = useState(false);  useEffect(() => {    setDidMount(true);  }, []);  if (didMount) {    // ... return client-only JSX ...  }  else {    // ... return initial JSX ...  }}

While the app is loading, the user will see the initial render output. Then, when it’s loaded and hydrated, your Effect will run and set `didMount` to `true`, triggering a re-render. This will switch to the client-only render output. Effects don’t run on the server, so this is why `didMount` was `false` during the initial server render.

Use this pattern sparingly. Keep in mind that users with a slow connection will see the initial content for quite a bit of time—potentially, many seconds—so you don’t want to make jarring changes to your component’s appearance. In many cases, you can avoid the need for this by conditionally showing different things with CSS.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My Effect runs twice when the component mounts[](#my-effect-runs-twice-when-the-component-mounts "Link for My Effect runs twice when the component mounts ")

When Strict Mode is on, in development, React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup.

This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development).

Read more about [how this helps find bugs](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) and [how to fix your logic.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

* * *

### My Effect runs after every re-render[](#my-effect-runs-after-every-re-render "Link for My Effect runs after every re-render ")

First, check that you haven’t forgotten to specify the dependency array:

    useEffect(() => {  // ...}); // 🚩 No dependency array: re-runs after every render!

If you’ve specified the dependency array but your Effect still re-runs in a loop, it’s because one of your dependencies is different on every re-render.

You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:

      useEffect(() => {    // ..  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);  console.log([serverUrl, roomId]);

You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as `temp1` and the second one got saved as `temp2`, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:

    Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...

When you find the dependency that is different on every re-render, you can usually fix it in one of these ways:

*   [Updating state based on previous state from an Effect](#updating-state-based-on-previous-state-from-an-effect)
*   [Removing unnecessary object dependencies](#removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies)
*   [Removing unnecessary function dependencies](#removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies)
*   [Reading the latest props and state from an Effect](#reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect)

As a last resort (if these methods didn’t help), wrap its creation with [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook) or [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback#preventing-an-effect-from-firing-too-often) (for functions).

### My Effect keeps re-running in an infinite cycle[](#my-effect-keeps-re-running-in-an-infinite-cycle "Link for My Effect keeps re-running in an infinite cycle ")

If your Effect runs in an infinite cycle, these two things must be true:

*   Your Effect is updating some state.
*   That state leads to a re-render, which causes the Effect’s dependencies to change.

Before you start fixing the problem, ask yourself whether your Effect is connecting to some external system (like DOM, network, a third-party widget, and so on). Why does your Effect need to set state? Does it synchronize with that external system? Or are you trying to manage your application’s data flow with it?

If there is no external system, consider whether [removing the Effect altogether](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) would simplify your logic.

If you’re genuinely synchronizing with some external system, think about why and under what conditions your Effect should update the state. Has something changed that affects your component’s visual output? If you need to keep track of some data that isn’t used by rendering, a [ref](/reference/react/useRef#referencing-a-value-with-a-ref) (which doesn’t trigger re-renders) might be more appropriate. Verify your Effect doesn’t update the state (and trigger re-renders) more than needed.

Finally, if your Effect is updating the state at the right time, but there is still a loop, it’s because that state update leads to one of the Effect’s dependencies changing. [Read how to debug dependency changes.](/reference/react/useEffect#my-effect-runs-after-every-re-render)

* * *

### My cleanup logic runs even though my component didn’t unmount[](#my-cleanup-logic-runs-even-though-my-component-didnt-unmount "Link for My cleanup logic runs even though my component didn’t unmount ")

The cleanup function runs not only during unmount, but before every re-render with changed dependencies. Additionally, in development, React [runs setup+cleanup one extra time immediately after component mounts.](#my-effect-runs-twice-when-the-component-mounts)

If you have cleanup code without corresponding setup code, it’s usually a code smell:

    useEffect(() => {  // 🔴 Avoid: Cleanup logic without corresponding setup logic  return () => {    doSomething();  };}, []);

Your cleanup logic should be “symmetrical” to the setup logic, and should stop or undo whatever setup did:

      useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => {      connection.disconnect();    };  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);

### My Effect does something visual, and I see a flicker before it runs[](#my-effect-does-something-visual-and-i-see-a-flicker-before-it-runs "Link for My Effect does something visual, and I see a flicker before it runs ")

If your Effect must block the browser from [painting the screen,](/learn/render-and-commit#epilogue-browser-paint) replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect). Note that **this shouldn’t be needed for the vast majority of Effects.** You’ll only need this if it’s crucial to run your Effect before the browser paint: for example, to measure and position a tooltip before the user sees it.

### Pitfall

**Do not call `useId` to generate keys in a list.** [Keys should be generated from your data.](/learn/rendering-lists#where-to-get-your-key)

### Generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes[](#generating-unique-ids-for-accessibility-attributes "Link for Generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes ")

Call `useId` at the top level of your component to generate a unique ID:

    import { useId } from 'react';function PasswordField() {  const passwordHintId = useId();  // ...

You can then pass the generated ID to different attributes:

    <>  <input type="password" aria-describedby={passwordHintId} />  <p id={passwordHintId}></>

**Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

[HTML accessibility attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) like [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) let you specify that two tags are related to each other. For example, you can specify that an element (like an input) is described by another element (like a paragraph).

In regular HTML, you would write it like this:

    <label>  Password:  <input    type="password"    aria-describedby="password-hint"  /></label><p id="password-hint">  The password should contain at least 18 characters</p>

However, hardcoding IDs like this is not a good practice in React. A component may be rendered more than once on the page—but IDs have to be unique! Instead of hardcoding an ID, generate a unique ID with `useId`:

    import { useId } from 'react';function PasswordField() {  const passwordHintId = useId();  return (    <>      <label>        Password:        <input          type="password"          aria-describedby={passwordHintId}        />      </label>      <p id={passwordHintId}>        The password should contain at least 18 characters      </p>    </>  );}

Now, even if `PasswordField` appears multiple times on the screen, the generated IDs won’t clash.

### Pitfall

With [server rendering](/reference/react-dom/server), **`useId` requires an identical component tree on the server and the client**. If the trees you render on the server and the client don’t match exactly, the generated IDs won’t match.

##### Deep Dive

#### Why is useId better than an incrementing counter?[](#why-is-useid-better-than-an-incrementing-counter "Link for Why is useId better than an incrementing counter? ")

Show Details

You might be wondering why `useId` is better than incrementing a global variable like `nextId++`.

The primary benefit of `useId` is that React ensures that it works with [server rendering.](/reference/react-dom/server) During server rendering, your components generate HTML output. Later, on the client, [hydration](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) attaches your event handlers to the generated HTML. For hydration to work, the client output must match the server HTML.

This is very difficult to guarantee with an incrementing counter because the order in which the Client Components are hydrated may not match the order in which the server HTML was emitted. By calling `useId`, you ensure that hydration will work, and the output will match between the server and the client.

Inside React, `useId` is generated from the “parent path” of the calling component. This is why, if the client and the server tree are the same, the “parent path” will match up regardless of rendering order.

* * *

### Generating IDs for several related elements[](#generating-ids-for-several-related-elements "Link for Generating IDs for several related elements ")

If you need to give IDs to multiple related elements, you can call `useId` to generate a shared prefix for them:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useId } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <form\>
      <label htmlFor\={id + '-firstName'}\>First Name:</label\>
      <input id\={id + '-firstName'} type\="text" />
      <hr />
      <label htmlFor\={id + '-lastName'}\>Last Name:</label\>
      <input id\={id + '-lastName'} type\="text" />
    </form\>
  );
}

This lets you avoid calling `useId` for every single element that needs a unique ID.

* * *

### Specifying a shared prefix for all generated IDs[](#specifying-a-shared-prefix-for-all-generated-ids "Link for Specifying a shared prefix for all generated IDs ")

If you render multiple independent React applications on a single page, pass `identifierPrefix` as an option to your [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#parameters) or [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) calls. This ensures that the IDs generated by the two different apps never clash because every identifier generated with `useId` will start with the distinct prefix you’ve specified.

index.jsindex.htmlApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.js';
import './styles.css';

const root1 = createRoot(document.getElementById('root1'), {
  identifierPrefix: 'my-first-app-'
});
root1.render(<App />);

const root2 = createRoot(document.getElementById('root2'), {
  identifierPrefix: 'my-second-app-'
});
root2.render(<App />);

* * *

### Using the same ID prefix on the client and the server[](#using-the-same-id-prefix-on-the-client-and-the-server "Link for Using the same ID prefix on the client and the server ")

If you [render multiple independent React apps on the same page](#specifying-a-shared-prefix-for-all-generated-ids), and some of these apps are server-rendered, make sure that the `identifierPrefix` you pass to the [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) call on the client side is the same as the `identifierPrefix` you pass to the [server APIs](/reference/react-dom/server) such as [`renderToPipeableStream`.](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream)

    // Serverimport { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server';const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(  <App />,  { identifierPrefix: 'react-app1' });

    // Clientimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';const domNode = document.getElementById('root');const root = hydrateRoot(  domNode,  reactNode,  { identifierPrefix: 'react-app1' });

You do not need to pass `identifierPrefix` if you only have one React app on the page.

`useImperativeHandle` is a React Hook that lets you customize the handle exposed as a [ref.](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs)

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useImperativeHandle(ref, createHandle, dependencies?)`[](#useimperativehandle "Link for this heading")

Call `useImperativeHandle` at the top level of your component to customize the ref handle it exposes:

    import { useImperativeHandle } from 'react';function MyInput({ ref }) {  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {    return {      // ... your methods ...    };  }, []);  // ...

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `ref`: The `ref` you received as a prop to the `MyInput` component.
    
*   `createHandle`: A function that takes no arguments and returns the ref handle you want to expose. That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.
    
*   **optional** `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `createHandle` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. If a re-render resulted in a change to some dependency, or if you omitted this argument, your `createHandle` function will re-execute, and the newly created handle will be assigned to the ref.
    

### Note

Starting with React 19, [`ref` is available as a prop.](/blog/2024/12/05/react-19#ref-as-a-prop) In React 18 and earlier, it was necessary to get the `ref` from [`forwardRef`.](/reference/react/forwardRef)

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useImperativeHandle` returns `undefined`.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Exposing a custom ref handle to the parent component[](#exposing-a-custom-ref-handle-to-the-parent-component "Link for Exposing a custom ref handle to the parent component ")

To expose a DOM node to the parent element, pass in the `ref` prop to the node.

    function MyInput({ ref }) {  return <input ref={ref} />;};

With the code above, [a ref to `MyInput` will receive the `<input>` DOM node.](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs) However, you can expose a custom value instead. To customize the exposed handle, call `useImperativeHandle` at the top level of your component:

    import { useImperativeHandle } from 'react';function MyInput({ ref }) {  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {    return {      // ... your methods ...    };  }, []);  return <input />;};

Note that in the code above, the `ref` is no longer passed to the `<input>`.

For example, suppose you don’t want to expose the entire `<input>` DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: `focus` and `scrollIntoView`. To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use `useImperativeHandle` to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call:

    import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';function MyInput({ ref }) {  const inputRef = useRef(null);  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {    return {      focus() {        inputRef.current.focus();      },      scrollIntoView() {        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();      },    };  }, []);  return <input ref={inputRef} />;};

Now, if the parent component gets a ref to `MyInput`, it will be able to call the `focus` and `scrollIntoView` methods on it. However, it will not have full access to the underlying `<input>` DOM node.

    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;

    </form\>
  );

### Exposing your own imperative methods[](#exposing-your-own-imperative-methods "Link for Exposing your own imperative methods ")

The methods you expose via an imperative handle don’t have to match the DOM methods exactly. For example, this `Post` component exposes a `scrollAndFocusAddComment` method via an imperative handle. This lets the parent `Page` scroll the list of comments _and_ focus the input field when you click the button:

App.jsPost.jsCommentList.jsAddComment.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useRef } from 'react';
import Post from './Post.js';

export default function Page() {
  const postRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    postRef.current.scrollAndFocusAddComment();
  }

  return (
    <\>
      <button onClick\={handleClick}\>
        Write a comment
      </button\>
      <Post ref\={postRef} />
    </\>
  );
}

### Pitfall

**Do not overuse refs.** You should only use refs for _imperative_ behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.

**If you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref.** For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like `{ open, close }` from a `Modal` component, it is better to take `isOpen` as a prop like `<Modal isOpen={isOpen} />`. [Effects](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.

useInsertionEffect[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
========================================================

### Pitfall

`useInsertionEffect` is for CSS-in-JS library authors. Unless you are working on a CSS-in-JS library and need a place to inject the styles, you probably want [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) or [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) instead.

`useInsertionEffect` allows inserting elements into the DOM before any layout Effects fire.

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useInsertionEffect(setup, dependencies?)`[](#useinsertioneffect "Link for this heading")

Call `useInsertionEffect` to insert styles before any Effects fire that may need to read layout:

    import { useInsertionEffect } from 'react';// Inside your CSS-in-JS libraryfunction useCSS(rule) {  useInsertionEffect(() => {    // ... inject <style> tags here ...  });  return rule;}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `setup`: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a _cleanup_ function. When your component is added to the DOM, but before any layout Effects fire, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. When your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.
    
*   **optional** `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `setup` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison algorithm. If you don’t specify the dependencies at all, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useInsertionEffect` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.
*   You can’t update state from inside `useInsertionEffect`.
*   By the time `useInsertionEffect` runs, refs are not attached yet.
*   `useInsertionEffect` may run either before or after the DOM has been updated. You shouldn’t rely on the DOM being updated at any particular time.
*   Unlike other types of Effects, which fire cleanup for every Effect and then setup for every Effect, `useInsertionEffect` will fire both cleanup and setup one component at a time. This results in an “interleaving” of the cleanup and setup functions.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Injecting dynamic styles from CSS-in-JS libraries[](#injecting-dynamic-styles-from-css-in-js-libraries "Link for Injecting dynamic styles from CSS-in-JS libraries ")

Traditionally, you would style React components using plain CSS.

    // In your JS file:<button className="success" />// In your CSS file:.success { color: green; }

Some teams prefer to author styles directly in JavaScript code instead of writing CSS files. This usually requires using a CSS-in-JS library or a tool. There are three common approaches to CSS-in-JS:

1.  Static extraction to CSS files with a compiler
2.  Inline styles, e.g. `<div style={{ opacity: 1 }}>`
3.  Runtime injection of `<style>` tags

If you use CSS-in-JS, we recommend a combination of the first two approaches (CSS files for static styles, inline styles for dynamic styles). **We don’t recommend runtime `<style>` tag injection for two reasons:**

1.  Runtime injection forces the browser to recalculate the styles a lot more often.
2.  Runtime injection can be very slow if it happens at the wrong time in the React lifecycle.

The first problem is not solvable, but `useInsertionEffect` helps you solve the second problem.

Call `useInsertionEffect` to insert the styles before any layout Effects fire:

    // Inside your CSS-in-JS librarylet isInserted = new Set();function useCSS(rule) {  useInsertionEffect(() => {    // As explained earlier, we don't recommend runtime injection of <style> tags.    // But if you have to do it, then it's important to do in useInsertionEffect.    if (!isInserted.has(rule)) {      isInserted.add(rule);      document.head.appendChild(getStyleForRule(rule));    }  });  return rule;}function Button() {  const className = useCSS('...');  return <div className={className} />;}

Similarly to `useEffect`, `useInsertionEffect` does not run on the server. If you need to collect which CSS rules have been used on the server, you can do it during rendering:

    let collectedRulesSet = new Set();function useCSS(rule) {  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {    collectedRulesSet.add(rule);  }  useInsertionEffect(() => {    // ...  });  return rule;}

[Read more about upgrading CSS-in-JS libraries with runtime injection to `useInsertionEffect`.](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/110)

##### Deep Dive

#### How is this better than injecting styles during rendering or useLayoutEffect?[](#how-is-this-better-than-injecting-styles-during-rendering-or-uselayouteffect "Link for How is this better than injecting styles during rendering or useLayoutEffect? ")

Show Details

If you insert styles during rendering and React is processing a [non-blocking update,](/reference/react/useTransition#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) the browser will recalculate the styles every single frame while rendering a component tree, which can be **extremely slow.**

`useInsertionEffect` is better than inserting styles during [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) or [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) because it ensures that by the time other Effects run in your components, the `<style>` tags have already been inserted. Otherwise, layout calculations in regular Effects would be wrong due to outdated styles.

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `setup`: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a _cleanup_ function. Before your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. Before your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useLayoutEffect` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useLayoutEffect` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a component and move the Effect there.
    
*   When Strict Mode is on, React will **run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle** before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, [implement the cleanup function.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)
    
*   If some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will **cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed.** To fix this, remove unnecessary [object](/reference/react/useEffect#removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies) and [function](/reference/react/useEffect#removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies) dependencies. You can also [extract state updates](/reference/react/useEffect#updating-state-based-on-previous-state-from-an-effect) and [non-reactive logic](/reference/react/useEffect#reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect) outside of your Effect.
    
*   Effects **only run on the client.** They don’t run during server rendering.
    
*   The code inside `useLayoutEffect` and all state updates scheduled from it **block the browser from repainting the screen.** When used excessively, this makes your app slow. When possible, prefer [`useEffect`.](/reference/react/useEffect)
    
*   If you trigger a state update inside `useLayoutEffect`, React will execute all remaining Effects immediately including `useEffect`.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Measuring layout before the browser repaints the screen[](#measuring-layout-before-the-browser-repaints-the-screen "Link for Measuring layout before the browser repaints the screen ")

Most components don’t need to know their position and size on the screen to decide what to render. They only return some JSX. Then the browser calculates their _layout_ (position and size) and repaints the screen.

Sometimes, that’s not enough. Imagine a tooltip that appears next to some element on hover. If there’s enough space, the tooltip should appear above the element, but if it doesn’t fit, it should appear below. In order to render the tooltip at the right final position, you need to know its height (i.e. whether it fits at the top).

To do this, you need to render in two passes:

1.  Render the tooltip anywhere (even with a wrong position).
2.  Measure its height and decide where to place the tooltip.
3.  Render the tooltip _again_ in the correct place.

**All of this needs to happen before the browser repaints the screen.** You don’t want the user to see the tooltip moving. Call `useLayoutEffect` to perform the layout measurements before the browser repaints the screen:

    function Tooltip() {  const ref = useRef(null);  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0); // You don't know real height yet  useLayoutEffect(() => {    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();    setTooltipHeight(height); // Re-render now that you know the real height  }, []);  // ...use tooltipHeight in the rendering logic below...}

Here’s how this works step by step:

1.  `Tooltip` renders with the initial `tooltipHeight = 0` (so the tooltip may be wrongly positioned).
2.  React places it in the DOM and runs the code in `useLayoutEffect`.
3.  Your `useLayoutEffect` [measures the height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) of the tooltip content and triggers an immediate re-render.
4.  `Tooltip` renders again with the real `tooltipHeight` (so the tooltip is correctly positioned).
5.  React updates it in the DOM, and the browser finally displays the tooltip.

Hover over the buttons below and see how the tooltip adjusts its position depending on whether it fits:

  let tooltipY = 0;
  if (targetRect !== null) {
    tooltipX = targetRect.left;
    tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight;
    if (tooltipY < 0) {
      // It doesn't fit above, so place below.
      tooltipY = targetRect.bottom;
    }
  }

  return createPortal(
    <TooltipContainer x\={tooltipX} y\={tooltipY} contentRef\={ref}\>
      {children}
    </TooltipContainer\>,
    document.body
  );
}

Notice that even though the `Tooltip` component has to render in two passes (first, with `tooltipHeight` initialized to `0` and then with the real measured height), you only see the final result. This is why you need `useLayoutEffect` instead of [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) for this example. Let’s look at the difference in detail below.

#### useLayoutEffect vs useEffect[](#examples "Link for useLayoutEffect vs useEffect")

1. `useLayoutEffect` blocks the browser from repainting 2. `useEffect` does not block the browser

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

`useLayoutEffect` blocks the browser from repainting[](#uselayouteffect-blocks-the-browser-from-repainting "Link for this heading")

React guarantees that the code inside `useLayoutEffect` and any state updates scheduled inside it will be processed **before the browser repaints the screen.** This lets you render the tooltip, measure it, and re-render the tooltip again without the user noticing the first extra render. In other words, `useLayoutEffect` blocks the browser from painting.

  if (targetRect !== null) {
    tooltipX = targetRect.left;

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### I’m getting an error: “`useLayoutEffect` does nothing on the server”[](#im-getting-an-error-uselayouteffect-does-nothing-on-the-server "Link for this heading")

The purpose of `useLayoutEffect` is to let your component [use layout information for rendering:](#measuring-layout-before-the-browser-repaints-the-screen)

1.  Render the initial content.
2.  Measure the layout _before the browser repaints the screen._
3.  Render the final content using the layout information you’ve read.

When you or your framework uses [server rendering](/reference/react-dom/server), your React app renders to HTML on the server for the initial render. This lets you show the initial HTML before the JavaScript code loads.

The problem is that on the server, there is no layout information.

In the [earlier example](#measuring-layout-before-the-browser-repaints-the-screen), the `useLayoutEffect` call in the `Tooltip` component lets it position itself correctly (either above or below content) depending on the content height. If you tried to render `Tooltip` as a part of the initial server HTML, this would be impossible to determine. On the server, there is no layout yet! So, even if you rendered it on the server, its position would “jump” on the client after the JavaScript loads and runs.

Usually, components that rely on layout information don’t need to render on the server anyway. For example, it probably doesn’t make sense to show a `Tooltip` during the initial render. It is triggered by a client interaction.

However, if you’re running into this problem, you have a few different options:

*   Replace `useLayoutEffect` with [`useEffect`.](/reference/react/useEffect) This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs).
    
*   Alternatively, [mark your component as client-only.](/reference/react/Suspense#providing-a-fallback-for-server-errors-and-client-only-content) This tells React to replace its content up to the closest [`<Suspense>`](/reference/react/Suspense) boundary with a loading fallback (for example, a spinner or a glimmer) during server rendering.
    
*   Alternatively, you can render a component with `useLayoutEffect` only after hydration. Keep a boolean `isMounted` state that’s initialized to `false`, and set it to `true` inside a `useEffect` call. Your rendering logic can then be like `return isMounted ? <RealContent /> : <FallbackContent />`. On the server and during the hydration, the user will see `FallbackContent` which should not call `useLayoutEffect`. Then React will replace it with `RealContent` which runs on the client only and can include `useLayoutEffect` calls.
    
*   If you synchronize your component with an external data store and rely on `useLayoutEffect` for different reasons than measuring layout, consider [`useSyncExternalStore`](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) instead which [supports server rendering.](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore#adding-support-for-server-rendering)

React will call your function during the initial render. On next renders, React will return the same value again if the `dependencies` have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will call `calculateValue`, return its result, and store it so it can be reused later.
    
*   `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `calculateValue` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

On the initial render, `useMemo` returns the result of calling `calculateValue` with no arguments.

During next renders, it will either return an already stored value from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or call `calculateValue` again, and return the result that `calculateValue` has returned.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useMemo` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
*   In Strict Mode, React will **call your calculation function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-calculation-runs-twice-on-every-re-render) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your calculation function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.
*   React **will not throw away the cached value unless there is a specific reason to do that.** For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on `useMemo` solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a [state variable](/reference/react/useState#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state) or a [ref](/reference/react/useRef#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents) may be more appropriate.

### Note

Caching return values like this is also known as [_memoization_,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) which is why this Hook is called `useMemo`.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Skipping expensive recalculations[](#skipping-expensive-recalculations "Link for Skipping expensive recalculations ")

To cache a calculation between re-renders, wrap it in a `useMemo` call at the top level of your component:

    import { useMemo } from 'react';function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);  // ...}

You need to pass two things to `useMemo`:

1.  A calculation function that takes no arguments, like `() =>`, and returns what you wanted to calculate.
2.  A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your calculation.

On the initial render, the value you’ll get from `useMemo` will be the result of calling your calculation.

On every subsequent render, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the last render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), `useMemo` will return the value you already calculated before. Otherwise, React will re-run your calculation and return the new value.

In other words, `useMemo` caches a calculation result between re-renders until its dependencies change.

**Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

By default, React will re-run the entire body of your component every time that it re-renders. For example, if this `TodoList` updates its state or receives new props from its parent, the `filterTodos` function will re-run:

    function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);  // ...}

Usually, this isn’t a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you’re filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn’t changed. If both `todos` and `tab` are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in `useMemo` like earlier lets you reuse `visibleTodos` you’ve already calculated before.

This type of caching is called _[memoization.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)_

### Note

**You should only rely on `useMemo` as a performance optimization.** If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add `useMemo` to improve performance.

##### Deep Dive

#### How to tell if a calculation is expensive?[](#how-to-tell-if-a-calculation-is-expensive "Link for How to tell if a calculation is expensive? ")

Show Details

In general, unless you’re creating or looping over thousands of objects, it’s probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code:

    console.time('filter array');const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);console.timeEnd('filter array');

Perform the interaction you’re measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like `filter array: 0.15ms` in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, `1ms` or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in `useMemo` to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not:

    console.time('filter array');const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {  return filterTodos(todos, tab); // Skipped if todos and tab haven't changed}, [todos, tab]);console.timeEnd('filter array');

`useMemo` won’t make the _first_ render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates.

Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users’ so it’s a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a [CPU Throttling](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling) option for this.

Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.

##### Deep Dive

#### Should you add useMemo everywhere?[](#should-you-add-usememo-everywhere "Link for Should you add useMemo everywhere? ")

Show Details

If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.

Optimizing with `useMemo` is only valuable in a few cases:

*   The calculation you’re putting in `useMemo` is noticeably slow, and its dependencies rarely change.
*   You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn’t changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only when dependencies aren’t the same.
*   The value you’re passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, maybe another `useMemo` calculation value depends on it. Or maybe you are depending on this value from [`useEffect.`](/reference/react/useEffect)

There is no benefit to wrapping a calculation in `useMemo` in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component.

**In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:**

1.  When a component visually wraps other components, let it [accept JSX as children.](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) This way, when the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don’t need to re-render.
2.  Prefer local state and don’t [lift state up](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) any further than necessary. For example, don’t keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library.
3.  Keep your [rendering logic pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it’s a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization.
4.  Avoid [unnecessary Effects that update state.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.
5.  Try to [remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) For example, instead of memoization, it’s often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component.

If a specific interaction still feels laggy, [use the React Developer Tools profiler](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we’re researching [doing granular memoization automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc) to solve this once and for all.

Example 1 of 2:

Skipping recalculation with `useMemo`[](#skipping-recalculation-with-usememo "Link for this heading")

In this example, the `filterTodos` implementation is **artificially slowed down** so that you can see what happens when some JavaScript function you’re calling during rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.

Switching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down `filterTodos` to re-execute. That’s expected because the `tab` has changed, and so the entire calculation _needs_ to re-run. (If you’re curious why it runs twice, it’s explained [here.](#my-calculation-runs-twice-on-every-re-render))

Toggle the theme. **Thanks to `useMemo`, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown!** The slow `filterTodos` call was skipped because both `todos` and `tab` (which you pass as dependencies to `useMemo`) haven’t changed since the last render.

### Skipping re-rendering of components[](#skipping-re-rendering-of-components "Link for Skipping re-rendering of components ")

In some cases, `useMemo` can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components. To illustrate this, let’s say this `TodoList` component passes the `visibleTodos` as a prop to the child `List` component:

    export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {  // ...  return (    <div className={theme}>      <List items={visibleTodos} />    </div>  );}

You’ve noticed that toggling the `theme` prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove `<List />` from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the `List` component.

**By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively.** This is why, when `TodoList` re-renders with a different `theme`, the `List` component _also_ re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you’ve verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell `List` to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in [`memo`:](/reference/react/memo)

    import { memo } from 'react';const List = memo(function List({ items }) {  // ...});

**With this change, `List` will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the _same_ as on the last render.** This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated `visibleTodos` without `useMemo`:

    export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different array...  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);  return (    <div className={theme}>      {/* ... so List's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}      <List items={visibleTodos} />    </div>  );}

**In the above example, the `filterTodos` function always creates a _different_ array,** similar to how the `{}` object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that `List` props will never be the same, and your [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) optimization won’t work. This is where `useMemo` comes in handy:

    export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {  // Tell React to cache your calculation between re-renders...  const visibleTodos = useMemo(    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),    [todos, tab] // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...  );  return (    <div className={theme}>      {/* ...List will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}      <List items={visibleTodos} />    </div>  );}

**By wrapping the `visibleTodos` calculation in `useMemo`, you ensure that it has the _same_ value between the re-renders** (until dependencies change). You don’t _have to_ wrap a calculation in `useMemo` unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in [`memo`,](/reference/react/memo) and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are a few other reasons to add `useMemo` which are described further on this page.

##### Deep Dive

#### Memoizing individual JSX nodes[](#memoizing-individual-jsx-nodes "Link for Memoizing individual JSX nodes ")

Show Details

Instead of wrapping `List` in [`memo`](/reference/react/memo), you could wrap the `<List />` JSX node itself in `useMemo`:

    export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);  const children = useMemo(() => <List items={visibleTodos} />, [visibleTodos]);  return (    <div className={theme}>      {children}    </div>  );}

The behavior would be the same. If the `visibleTodos` haven’t changed, `List` won’t be re-rendered.

A JSX node like `<List items={visibleTodos} />` is an object like `{ type: List, props: { items: visibleTodos } }`. Creating this object is very cheap, but React doesn’t know whether its contents is the same as last time or not. This is why by default, React will re-render the `List` component.

However, if React sees the same exact JSX as during the previous render, it won’t try to re-render your component. This is because JSX nodes are [immutable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) A JSX node object could not have changed over time, so React knows it’s safe to skip a re-render. However, for this to work, the node has to _actually be the same object_, not merely look the same in code. This is what `useMemo` does in this example.

Manually wrapping JSX nodes into `useMemo` is not convenient. For example, you can’t do this conditionally. This is usually why you would wrap components with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) instead of wrapping JSX nodes.

In this example, the `List` component is **artificially slowed down** so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.

Switching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down `List` to re-render. That’s expected because the `tab` has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.

Next, try toggling the theme. **Thanks to `useMemo` together with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo), it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown!** The `List` skipped re-rendering because the `visibleTodos` array has not changed since the last render. The `visibleTodos` array has not changed because both `todos` and `tab` (which you pass as dependencies to `useMemo`) haven’t changed since the last render.

### Preventing an Effect from firing too often[](#preventing-an-effect-from-firing-too-often "Link for Preventing an Effect from firing too often ")

Sometimes, you might want to use a value inside an [Effect:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  const options = {    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',    roomId: roomId  }  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    // ...

This creates a problem. [Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) However, if you declare `options` as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:

      useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [options]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render  // ...

To solve this, you can wrap the object you need to call from an Effect in `useMemo`:

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  const options = useMemo(() => {    return {      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',      roomId: roomId    };  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [options]); // ✅ Only changes when options changes  // ...

This ensures that the `options` object is the same between re-renders if `useMemo` returns the cached object.

However, since `useMemo` is performance optimization, not a semantic guarantee, React may throw away the cached value if [there is a specific reason to do that](#caveats). This will also cause the effect to re-fire, **so it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency** by moving your object _inside_ the Effect:

    function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');  useEffect(() => {    const options = { // ✅ No need for useMemo or object dependencies!      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',      roomId: roomId    }        const connection = createConnection(options);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes  // ...

Now your code is simpler and doesn’t need `useMemo`. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)

### Memoizing a dependency of another Hook[](#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook "Link for Memoizing a dependency of another Hook ")

Suppose you have a calculation that depends on an object created directly in the component body:

    function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {  const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // 🚩 Caution: Dependency on an object created in the component body  // ...

Depending on an object like this defeats the point of memoization. When a component re-renders, all of the code directly inside the component body runs again. **The lines of code creating the `searchOptions` object will also run on every re-render.** Since `searchOptions` is a dependency of your `useMemo` call, and it’s different every time, React knows the dependencies are different, and recalculate `searchItems` every time.

To fix this, you could memoize the `searchOptions` object _itself_ before passing it as a dependency:

    function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {    return { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };  }, [text]); // ✅ Only changes when text changes  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or searchOptions changes  // ...

In the example above, if the `text` did not change, the `searchOptions` object also won’t change. However, an even better fix is to move the `searchOptions` object declaration _inside_ of the `useMemo` calculation function:

    function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {    const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);  }, [allItems, text]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or text changes  // ...

Now your calculation depends on `text` directly (which is a string and can’t “accidentally” become different).

* * *

### Memoizing a function[](#memoizing-a-function "Link for Memoizing a function ")

Suppose the `Form` component is wrapped in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) You want to pass a function to it as a prop:

    export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails    });  }  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;}

Just as `{}` creates a different object, function declarations like `function() {}` and expressions like `() => {}` produce a _different_ function on every re-render. By itself, creating a new function is not a problem. This is not something to avoid! However, if the `Form` component is memoized, presumably you want to skip re-rendering it when no props have changed. A prop that is _always_ different would defeat the point of memoization.

To memoize a function with `useMemo`, your calculation function would have to return another function:

    export default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {  const handleSubmit = useMemo(() => {    return (orderDetails) => {      post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {        referrer,        orderDetails      });    };  }, [productId, referrer]);  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;}

This looks clunky! **Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) instead of `useMemo`** to avoid having to write an extra nested function:

    export default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {      referrer,      orderDetails    });  }, [productId, referrer]);  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;}

The two examples above are completely equivalent. The only benefit to `useCallback` is that it lets you avoid writing an extra nested function inside. It doesn’t do anything else. [Read more about `useCallback`.](/reference/react/useCallback)

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My calculation runs twice on every re-render[](#my-calculation-runs-twice-on-every-re-render "Link for My calculation runs twice on every re-render ")

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:

    function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {  // This component function will run twice for every render.  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {    // This calculation will run twice if any of the dependencies change.    return filterTodos(todos, tab);  }, [todos, tab]);  // ...

This is expected and shouldn’t break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake.

For example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop:

      const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {    // 🚩 Mistake: mutating a prop    todos.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);    return filtered;  }, [todos, tab]);

React calls your function twice, so you’d notice the todo is added twice. Your calculation shouldn’t change any existing objects, but it’s okay to change any _new_ objects you created during the calculation. For example, if the `filterTodos` function always returns a _different_ array, you can mutate _that_ array instead:

      const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);    // ✅ Correct: mutating an object you created during the calculation    filtered.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });    return filtered;  }, [todos, tab]);

Read [keeping components pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure) to learn more about purity.

Also, check out the guides on [updating objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) without mutation.

### My `useMemo` call is supposed to return an object, but returns undefined[](#my-usememo-call-is-supposed-to-return-an-object-but-returns-undefined "Link for this heading")

This code doesn’t work:

      // 🔴 You can't return an object from an arrow function with () => {  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {    matchMode: 'whole-word',    text: text  }, [text]);

In JavaScript, `() => {` starts the arrow function body, so the `{` brace is not a part of your object. This is why it doesn’t return an object, and leads to mistakes. You could fix it by adding parentheses like `({` and `})`:

      // This works, but is easy for someone to break again  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => ({    matchMode: 'whole-word',    text: text  }), [text]);

However, this is still confusing and too easy for someone to break by removing the parentheses.

To avoid this mistake, write a `return` statement explicitly:

      // ✅ This works and is explicit  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {    return {      matchMode: 'whole-word',      text: text    };  }, [text]);

* * *

### Every time my component renders, the calculation in `useMemo` re-runs[](#every-time-my-component-renders-the-calculation-in-usememo-re-runs "Link for this heading")

Make sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!

If you forget the dependency array, `useMemo` will re-run the calculation every time:

    function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {  // 🔴 Recalculates every time: no dependency array  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab));  // ...

This is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:

    function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {  // ✅ Does not recalculate unnecessarily  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);  // ...

If this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:

      const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);  console.log([todos, tab]);

You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as `temp1` and the second one got saved as `temp2`, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:

    Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...

When you find which dependency breaks memoization, either find a way to remove it, or [memoize it as well.](#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook)

### I need to call `useMemo` for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed[](#i-need-to-call-usememo-for-each-list-item-in-a-loop-but-its-not-allowed "Link for this heading")

Suppose the `Chart` component is wrapped in [`memo`](/reference/react/memo). You want to skip re-rendering every `Chart` in the list when the `ReportList` component re-renders. However, you can’t call `useMemo` in a loop:

    function ReportList({ items }) {  return (    <article>      {items.map(item => {        // 🔴 You can't call useMemo in a loop like this:        const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);        return (          <figure key={item.id}>            <Chart data={data} />          </figure>        );      })}    </article>  );}

Instead, extract a component for each item and memoize data for individual items:

    function ReportList({ items }) {  return (    <article>      {items.map(item =>        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />      )}    </article>  );}function Report({ item }) {  // ✅ Call useMemo at the top level:  const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);  return (    <figure>      <Chart data={data} />    </figure>  );}

Alternatively, you could remove `useMemo` and instead wrap `Report` itself in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) If the `item` prop does not change, `Report` will skip re-rendering, so `Chart` will skip re-rendering too:

    function ReportList({ items }) {  // ...}const Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {  const data = calculateReport(item);  return (    <figure>      <Chart data={data} />    </figure>  );});

useOptimistic[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===================================================

`useOptimistic` is a React Hook that lets you optimistically update the UI.

      const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(state, updateFn);

*   [Reference](#reference)
    *   [`useOptimistic(state, updateFn)`](#use)
*   [Usage](#usage)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useOptimistic(state, updateFn)`[](#use "Link for this heading")

`useOptimistic` is a React Hook that lets you show a different state while an async action is underway. It accepts some state as an argument and returns a copy of that state that can be different during the duration of an async action such as a network request. You provide a function that takes the current state and the input to the action, and returns the optimistic state to be used while the action is pending.

This state is called the “optimistic” state because it is usually used to immediately present the user with the result of performing an action, even though the action actually takes time to complete.

    import { useOptimistic } from 'react';function AppContainer() {  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(    state,    // updateFn    (currentState, optimisticValue) => {      // merge and return new state      // with optimistic value    }  );}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `state`: the value to be returned initially and whenever no action is pending.
*   `updateFn(currentState, optimisticValue)`: a function that takes the current state and the optimistic value passed to `addOptimistic` and returns the resulting optimistic state. It must be a pure function. `updateFn` takes in two parameters. The `currentState` and the `optimisticValue`. The return value will be the merged value of the `currentState` and `optimisticValue`.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

*   `optimisticState`: The resulting optimistic state. It is equal to `state` unless an action is pending, in which case it is equal to the value returned by `updateFn`.
*   `addOptimistic`: `addOptimistic` is the dispatching function to call when you have an optimistic update. It takes one argument, `optimisticValue`, of any type and will call the `updateFn` with `state` and `optimisticValue`.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Optimistically updating forms[](#optimistically-updating-with-forms "Link for Optimistically updating forms ")

The `useOptimistic` Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.

For example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the `useOptimistic` Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)`[](#usereducer "Link for this heading")

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage its state with a [reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

    import { useReducer } from 'react';function reducer(state, action) {  // ...}function MyComponent() {  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });  // ...

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `reducer`: The reducer function that specifies how the state gets updated. It must be pure, should take the state and action as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.
*   `initialArg`: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next `init` argument.
*   **optional** `init`: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it’s not specified, the initial state is set to `initialArg`. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling `init(initialArg)`.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useReducer` returns an array with exactly two values:

1.  The current state. During the first render, it’s set to `init(initialArg)` or `initialArg` (if there’s no `init`).
2.  The [`dispatch` function](#dispatch) that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useReducer` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
*   The `dispatch` function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)
*   In Strict Mode, React will **call your reducer and initializer twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-reducer-or-initializer-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your reducer and initializer are pure (as they should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls is ignored.

* * *

### `dispatch` function[](#dispatch "Link for this heading")

The `dispatch` function returned by `useReducer` lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the action as the only argument to the `dispatch` function:

    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });function handleClick() {  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });  // ...

React will set the next state to the result of calling the `reducer` function you’ve provided with the current `state` and the action you’ve passed to `dispatch`.

#### Parameters[](#dispatch-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `action`: The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a `type` property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information.

#### Returns[](#dispatch-returns "Link for Returns ")

`dispatch` functions do not have a return value.

#### Caveats[](#setstate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   The `dispatch` function **only updates the state variable for the _next_ render**. If you read the state variable after calling the `dispatch` function, [you will still get the old value](#ive-dispatched-an-action-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-state-value) that was on the screen before your call.
    
*   If the new value you provide is identical to the current `state`, as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison, React will **skip re-rendering the component and its children.** This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn’t affect your code.
    
*   React [batches state updates.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) It updates the screen **after all the event handlers have run** and have called their `set` functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use [`flushSync`.](/reference/react-dom/flushSync)

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Adding a reducer to a component[](#adding-a-reducer-to-a-component "Link for Adding a reducer to a component ")

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage state with a [reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

    import { useReducer } from 'react';function reducer(state, action) {  // ...}function MyComponent() {  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });  // ...

`useReducer` returns an array with exactly two items:

1.  The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.
2.  The `dispatch` function that lets you change it in response to interaction.

To update what’s on the screen, call `dispatch` with an object representing what the user did, called an _action_:

    function handleClick() {  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });}

React will pass the current state and the action to your reducer function. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.

`useReducer` is very similar to [`useState`](/reference/react/useState), but it lets you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component.

* * *

### Writing the reducer function[](#writing-the-reducer-function "Link for Writing the reducer function ")

A reducer function is declared like this:

    function reducer(state, action) {  // ...}

Then you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a [`switch` statement.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) For each `case` in the `switch`, calculate and return some next state.

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'incremented_age': {      return {        name: state.name,        age: state.age + 1      };    }    case 'changed_name': {      return {        name: action.nextName,        age: state.age      };    }  }  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);}

Actions can have any shape. By convention, it’s common to pass objects with a `type` property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.

    function Form() {  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 });    function handleButtonClick() {    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });  }  function handleInputChange(e) {    dispatch({      type: 'changed_name',      nextName: e.target.value    });  }  // ...

The action type names are local to your component. [Each action describes a single interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in data.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer#writing-reducers-well) The shape of the state is arbitrary, but usually it’ll be an object or an array.

Read [extracting state logic into a reducer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) to learn more.

### Pitfall

State is read-only. Don’t modify any objects or arrays in state:

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'incremented_age': {      // 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:      state.age = state.age + 1;      return state;    }

Instead, always return new objects from your reducer:

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'incremented_age': {      // ✅ Instead, return a new object      return {        ...state,        age: state.age + 1      };    }

### Avoiding recreating the initial state[](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state "Link for Avoiding recreating the initial state ")

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

    function createInitialState(username) {  // ...}function TodoList({ username }) {  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, createInitialState(username));  // ...

Although the result of `createInitialState(username)` is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useReducer` as the third argument instead:

    function createInitialState(username) {  // ...}function TodoList({ username }) {  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, username, createInitialState);  // ...

Notice that you’re passing `createInitialState`, which is the _function itself_, and not `createInitialState()`, which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.

In the above example, `createInitialState` takes a `username` argument. If your initializer doesn’t need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass `null` as the second argument to `useReducer`.

#### The difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly[](#examples-initializer "Link for The difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly")

1. Passing the initializer function 2. Passing the initial state directly

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

Passing the initializer function[](#passing-the-initializer-function "Link for this heading")

This example passes the initializer function, so the `createInitialState` function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.

### I’ve dispatched an action, but logging gives me the old state value[](#ive-dispatched-an-action-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-state-value "Link for I’ve dispatched an action, but logging gives me the old state value ")

Calling the `dispatch` function **does not change state in the running code**:

    function handleClick() {  console.log(state.age);  // 42  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' }); // Request a re-render with 43  console.log(state.age);  // Still 42!  setTimeout(() => {    console.log(state.age); // Also 42!  }, 5000);}

This is because [states behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the `state` JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.

If you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself:

    const action = { type: 'incremented_age' };dispatch(action);const nextState = reducer(state, action);console.log(state);     // { age: 42 }console.log(nextState); // { age: 43 }

* * *

### I’ve dispatched an action, but the screen doesn’t update[](#ive-dispatched-an-action-but-the-screen-doesnt-update "Link for I’ve dispatched an action, but the screen doesn’t update ")

React will **ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state,** as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'incremented_age': {      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object      state.age++;      return state;    }    case 'changed_name': {      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object      state.name = action.nextName;      return state;    }    // ...  }}

You mutated an existing `state` object and returned it, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always [updating objects in state](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays in state](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) instead of mutating them:

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'incremented_age': {      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object      return {        ...state,        age: state.age + 1      };    }    case 'changed_name': {      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object      return {        ...state,        name: action.nextName      };    }    // ...  }}

* * *

### A part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching[](#a-part-of-my-reducer-state-becomes-undefined-after-dispatching "Link for A part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching ")

Make sure that every `case` branch **copies all of the existing fields** when returning the new state:

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'incremented_age': {      return {        ...state, // Don't forget this!        age: state.age + 1      };    }    // ...

Without `...state` above, the returned next state would only contain the `age` field and nothing else.

* * *

### My entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching[](#my-entire-reducer-state-becomes-undefined-after-dispatching "Link for My entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching ")

If your state unexpectedly becomes `undefined`, you’re likely forgetting to `return` state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn’t match any of the `case` statements. To find why, throw an error outside the `switch`:

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'incremented_age': {      // ...    }    case 'edited_name': {      // ...    }  }  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);}

You can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.

* * *

### I’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders”[](#im-getting-an-error-too-many-re-renders "Link for I’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” ")

You might get an error that says: `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.` Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally dispatching an action _during render_, so your component enters a loop: render, dispatch (which causes a render), render, dispatch (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:

    // 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during renderreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handlerreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline functionreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>

If you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific `dispatch` function call responsible for the error.

* * *

### My reducer or initializer function runs twice[](#my-reducer-or-initializer-function-runs-twice "Link for My reducer or initializer function runs twice ")

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call your reducer and initializer functions twice. This shouldn’t break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and reducer functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.

For example, this impure reducer function mutates an array in state:

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'added_todo': {      // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state      state.todos.push({ id: nextId++, text: action.text });      return state;    }    // ...  }}

Because React calls your reducer function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by [replacing the array instead of mutating it](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state#adding-to-an-array):

    function reducer(state, action) {  switch (action.type) {    case 'added_todo': {      // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state      return {        ...state,        todos: [          ...state.todos,          { id: nextId++, text: action.text }        ]      };    }    // ...  }}

Now that this reducer function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. **Only component, initializer, and reducer functions need to be pure.** Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

useRef[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
============================================

`useRef` is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering.

    const ref = useRef(initialValue)

*   [Reference](#reference)
    *   [`useRef(initialValue)`](#useref)
*   [Usage](#usage)
    *   [Referencing a value with a ref](#referencing-a-value-with-a-ref)

    *   [I can’t get a ref to a custom component](#i-cant-get-a-ref-to-a-custom-component)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useRef(initialValue)`[](#useref "Link for this heading")

Call `useRef` at the top level of your component to declare a [ref.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)

    import { useRef } from 'react';function MyComponent() {  const intervalRef = useRef(0);  const inputRef = useRef(null);  // ...

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `initialValue`: The value you want the ref object’s `current` property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useRef` returns an object with a single property:

*   `current`: Initially, it’s set to the `initialValue` you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a `ref` attribute to a JSX node, React will set its `current` property.

On the next renders, `useRef` will return the same object.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   You can mutate the `ref.current` property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn’t mutate that object.
*   When you change the `ref.current` property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.
*   Do not write _or read_ `ref.current` during rendering, except for [initialization.](#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents) This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable.
*   In Strict Mode, React will **call your component function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](/reference/react/useState#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Referencing a value with a ref[](#referencing-a-value-with-a-ref "Link for Referencing a value with a ref ")

Call `useRef` at the top level of your component to declare one or more [refs.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)

    import { useRef } from 'react';function Stopwatch() {  const intervalRef = useRef(0);  // ...

`useRef` returns a ref object with a single `current` property initially set to the initial value you provided.

On the next renders, `useRef` will return the same object. You can change its `current` property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of [state](/reference/react/useState), but there is an important difference.

**Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render.** This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an [interval ID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its `current` property:

    function handleStartClick() {  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {    // ...  }, 1000);  intervalRef.current = intervalId;}

Later, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call [clear that interval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval):

    function handleStopClick() {  const intervalId = intervalRef.current;  clearInterval(intervalId);}

By using a ref, you ensure that:

*   You can **store information** between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).
*   Changing it **does not trigger a re-render** (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
*   The **information is local** to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).

Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead. Read more about [choosing between `useRef` and `useState`.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs#differences-between-refs-and-state)

#### Examples of referencing a value with useRef[](#examples-value "Link for Examples of referencing a value with useRef")

1. Click counter 2. A stopwatch

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

Click counter[](#click-counter "Link for this heading")

This component uses a ref to keep track of how many times the button was clicked. Note that it’s okay to use a ref instead of state here because the click count is only read and written in an event handler.

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick\={handleClick}\>
      Click me!
    </button\>
  );
}

Show more

If you show `{ref.current}` in the JSX, the number won’t update on click. This is because setting `ref.current` does not trigger a re-render. Information that’s used for rendering should be state instead.

Next Example

### Pitfall

**Do not write _or read_ `ref.current` during rendering.**

React expects that the body of your component [behaves like a pure function](/learn/keeping-components-pure):

*   If the inputs ([props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component), [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), and [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.
*   Calling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.

Reading or writing a ref **during rendering** breaks these expectations.

    function MyComponent() {  // ...  // 🚩 Don't write a ref during rendering  myRef.current = 123;  // ...  // 🚩 Don't read a ref during rendering  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>;}

You can read or write refs **from event handlers or effects instead**.

    function MyComponent() {  // ...  useEffect(() => {    // ✅ You can read or write refs in effects    myRef.current = 123;  });  // ...  function handleClick() {    // ✅ You can read or write refs in event handlers    doSomething(myOtherRef.current);  }  // ...}

If you _have to_ read [or write](/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders) something during rendering, [use state](/reference/react/useState) instead.

When you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features we’re adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about [keeping your components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure#where-you-_can_-cause-side-effects)

### Manipulating the DOM with a ref[](#manipulating-the-dom-with-a-ref "Link for Manipulating the DOM with a ref ")

It’s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the [DOM.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API) React has built-in support for this.

First, declare a ref object with an initial value of `null`:

    import { useRef } from 'react';function MyComponent() {  const inputRef = useRef(null);  // ...

Then pass your ref object as the `ref` attribute to the JSX of the DOM node you want to manipulate:

      // ...  return <input ref={inputRef} />;

After React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set the `current` property of your ref object to that DOM node. Now you can access the `<input>`’s DOM node and call methods like [`focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus):

      function handleClick() {    inputRef.current.focus();  }

React will set the `current` property back to `null` when the node is removed from the screen.

Example 1 of 4:

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <\>
      <input ref\={inputRef} />

### Avoiding recreating the ref contents[](#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents "Link for Avoiding recreating the ref contents ")

React saves the initial ref value once and ignores it on the next renders.

    function Video() {  const playerRef = useRef(new VideoPlayer());  // ...

Although the result of `new VideoPlayer()` is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating expensive objects.

To solve it, you may initialize the ref like this instead:

    function Video() {  const playerRef = useRef(null);  if (playerRef.current === null) {    playerRef.current = new VideoPlayer();  }  // ...

Normally, writing or reading `ref.current` during render is not allowed. However, it’s fine in this case because the result is always the same, and the condition only executes during initialization so it’s fully predictable.

##### Deep Dive

#### How to avoid null checks when initializing useRef later[](#how-to-avoid-null-checks-when-initializing-use-ref-later "Link for How to avoid null checks when initializing useRef later ")

Show Details

If you use a type checker and don’t want to always check for `null`, you can try a pattern like this instead:

    function Video() {  const playerRef = useRef(null);  function getPlayer() {    if (playerRef.current !== null) {      return playerRef.current;    }    const player = new VideoPlayer();    playerRef.current = player;    return player;  }  // ...

Here, the `playerRef` itself is nullable. However, you should be able to convince your type checker that there is no case in which `getPlayer()` returns `null`. Then use `getPlayer()` in your event handlers.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### I can’t get a ref to a custom component[](#i-cant-get-a-ref-to-a-custom-component "Link for I can’t get a ref to a custom component ")

If you try to pass a `ref` to your own component like this:

    const inputRef = useRef(null);return <MyInput ref={inputRef} />;

You might get an error in the console:

Console

TypeError: Cannot read properties of null

By default, your own components don’t expose refs to the DOM nodes inside them.

To fix this, find the component that you want to get a ref to:

    export default function MyInput({ value, onChange }) {  return (    <input      value={value}      onChange={onChange}    />  );}

And then add `ref` to the list of props your component accepts and pass `ref` as a prop to the relevent child [built-in component](/reference/react-dom/components/common) like this:

    function MyInput({ value, onChange, ref }) {  return (    <input      value={value}      onChange={onChange}      ref={ref}    />  );};export default MyInput;

Then the parent component can get a ref to it.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useState(initialState)`[](#usestate "Link for this heading")

Call `useState` at the top level of your component to declare a [state variable.](/learn/state-a-components-memory)

    import { useState } from 'react';function MyComponent() {  const [age, setAge] = useState(28);  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => createTodos());  // ...

The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using [array destructuring.](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `initialState`: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
    *   If you pass a function as `initialState`, it will be treated as an _initializer function_. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. [See an example below.](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state)

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useState` returns an array with exactly two values:

1.  The current state. During the first render, it will match the `initialState` you have passed.
2.  The [`set` function](#setstate) that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useState` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
*   In Strict Mode, React will **call your initializer function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your initializer function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.

* * *

### `set` functions, like `setSomething(nextState)`[](#setstate "Link for this heading")

The `set` function returned by `useState` lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:

    const [name, setName] = useState('Edward');function handleClick() {  setName('Taylor');  setAge(a => a + 1);  // ...

#### Parameters[](#setstate-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `nextState`: The value that you want the state to be. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions.
    *   If you pass a function as `nextState`, it will be treated as an _updater function_. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. [See an example below.](#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state)

#### Returns[](#setstate-returns "Link for Returns ")

`set` functions do not have a return value.

#### Caveats[](#setstate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   The `set` function **only updates the state variable for the _next_ render**. If you read the state variable after calling the `set` function, [you will still get the old value](#ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value) that was on the screen before your call.
    
*   If the new value you provide is identical to the current `state`, as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison, React will **skip re-rendering the component and its children.** This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn’t affect your code.
    
*   React [batches state updates.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) It updates the screen **after all the event handlers have run** and have called their `set` functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use [`flushSync`.](/reference/react-dom/flushSync)
    
*   The `set` function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)
    
*   Calling the `set` function _during rendering_ is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to **store information from the previous renders**. [See an example below.](#storing-information-from-previous-renders)
    
*   In Strict Mode, React will **call your updater function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your updater function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Adding state to a component[](#adding-state-to-a-component "Link for Adding state to a component ")

Call `useState` at the top level of your component to declare one or more [state variables.](/learn/state-a-components-memory)

    import { useState } from 'react';function MyComponent() {  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');  // ...

The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using [array destructuring.](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)

`useState` returns an array with exactly two items:

1.  The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.
2.  The `set` function that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.

To update what’s on the screen, call the `set` function with some next state:

    function handleClick() {  setName('Robin');}

React will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.

### Pitfall

Calling the `set` function [**does not** change the current state in the already executing code](#ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value):

    function handleClick() {  setName('Robin');  console.log(name); // Still "Taylor"!}

It only affects what `useState` will return starting from the _next_ render.

#### Basic useState examples[](#examples-basic "Link for Basic useState examples")

1. Counter (number) 2. Text field (string) 3. Checkbox (boolean) 4. Form (two variables)

#### 

Example 1 of 4:

In this example, the `count` state variable holds a number. Clicking the button increments it.

App.js

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick\={handleClick}\>
      You pressed me {count} times
    </button\>
  );
}

Next Example

* * *

### Updating state based on the previous state[](#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state "Link for Updating state based on the previous state ")

Suppose the `age` is `42`. This handler calls `setAge(age + 1)` three times:

    function handleClick() {  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)}

However, after one click, `age` will only be `43` rather than `45`! This is because calling the `set` function [does not update](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) the `age` state variable in the already running code. So each `setAge(age + 1)` call becomes `setAge(43)`.

To solve this problem, **you may pass an _updater function_** to `setAge` instead of the next state:

    function handleClick() {  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)}

Here, `a => a + 1` is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.

React puts your updater functions in a [queue.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:

1.  `a => a + 1` will receive `42` as the pending state and return `43` as the next state.
2.  `a => a + 1` will receive `43` as the pending state and return `44` as the next state.
3.  `a => a + 1` will receive `44` as the pending state and return `45` as the next state.

There are no other queued updates, so React will store `45` as the current state in the end.

By convention, it’s common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like `a` for `age`. However, you may also call it like `prevAge` or something else that you find clearer.

##### Deep Dive

#### Is using an updater always preferred?[](#is-using-an-updater-always-preferred "Link for Is using an updater always preferred? ")

Show Details

You might hear a recommendation to always write code like `setAge(a => a + 1)` if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state. There is no harm in it, but it is also not always necessary.

In most cases, there is no difference between these two approaches. React always makes sure that for intentional user actions, like clicks, the `age` state variable would be updated before the next click. This means there is no risk of a click handler seeing a “stale” `age` at the beginning of the event handler.

However, if you do multiple updates within the same event, updaters can be helpful. They’re also helpful if accessing the state variable itself is inconvenient (you might run into this when optimizing re-renders).

If you prefer consistency over slightly more verbose syntax, it’s reasonable to always write an updater if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state. If it’s calculated from the previous state of some _other_ state variable, you might want to combine them into one object and [use a reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

### Updating objects and arrays in state[](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state "Link for Updating objects and arrays in state ")

You can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so **you should _replace_ it rather than _mutate_ your existing objects**. For example, if you have a `form` object in state, don’t mutate it:

    // 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:form.firstName = 'Taylor';

Instead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:

    // ✅ Replace state with a new objectsetForm({  ...form,  firstName: 'Taylor'});

#### 

Example 1 of 4:

Form (object)[](#form-object "Link for this heading")

In this example, the `form` state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls `setForm` with the next state of the entire form. The `{ ...form }` spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.

### Avoiding recreating the initial state[](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state "Link for Avoiding recreating the initial state ")

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

    function TodoList() {  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos());  // ...

Although the result of `createInitialTodos()` is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useState` instead:

    function TodoList() {  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);  // ...

Notice that you’re passing `createInitialTodos`, which is the _function itself_, and not `createInitialTodos()`, which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to `useState`, React will only call it during initialization.

React may [call your initializers twice](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) in development to verify that they are [pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

### Resetting state with a key[](#resetting-state-with-a-key "Link for Resetting state with a key ")

You’ll often encounter the `key` attribute when [rendering lists.](/learn/rendering-lists) However, it also serves another purpose.

You can **reset a component’s state by passing a different `key` to a component.** In this example, the Reset button changes the `version` state variable, which we pass as a `key` to the `Form`. When the `key` changes, React re-creates the `Form` component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.

### Storing information from previous renders[](#storing-information-from-previous-renders "Link for Storing information from previous renders ")

Usually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering — for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.

In most cases, you don’t need this:

*   **If the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, [remove that redundant state altogether.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state)** If you’re worried about recomputing too often, the [`useMemo` Hook](/reference/react/useMemo) can help.
*   If you want to reset the entire component tree’s state, [pass a different `key` to your component.](#resetting-state-with-a-key)
*   If you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers.

In the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a `set` function while your component is rendering.

Here’s an example. This `CountLabel` component displays the `count` prop passed to it:

    export default function CountLabel({ count }) {  return <h1>{count}</h1>}

Say you want to show whether the counter has _increased or decreased_ since the last change. The `count` prop doesn’t tell you this — you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the `prevCount` state variable to track it. Add another state variable called `trend` to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare `prevCount` with `count`, and if they’re not equal, update both `prevCount` and `trend`. Now you can show both the current count prop and _how it has changed since the last render_.

App.jsCountLabel.js

CountLabel.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function CountLabel({ count }) {
  const \[prevCount, setPrevCount\] = useState(count);
  const \[trend, setTrend\] = useState(null);
  if (prevCount !== count) {
    setPrevCount(count);
    setTrend(count > prevCount ? 'increasing' : 'decreasing');
  }
  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>{count}</h1\>
      {trend && <p\>The count is {trend}</p\>}
    </\>
  );
}

Show more

Note that if you call a `set` function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like `prevCount !== count`, and there must be a call like `setPrevCount(count)` inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the _currently rendering_ component like this. Calling the `set` function of _another_ component during rendering is an error. Finally, your `set` call should still [update state without mutation](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state) — this doesn’t mean you can break other rules of [pure functions.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

This pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it’s better than updating state in an effect. When you call the `set` function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a `return` statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don’t need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early `return;` to restart rendering earlier.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### I’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value[](#ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value "Link for I’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value ")

Calling the `set` function **does not change state in the running code**:

    function handleClick() {  console.log(count);  // 0  setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1  console.log(count);  // Still 0!  setTimeout(() => {    console.log(count); // Also 0!  }, 5000);}

This is because [states behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the `count` JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.

If you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the `set` function:

    const nextCount = count + 1;setCount(nextCount);console.log(count);     // 0console.log(nextCount); // 1

* * *

### I’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update[](#ive-updated-the-state-but-the-screen-doesnt-update "Link for I’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update ")

React will **ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state,** as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:

    obj.x = 10;  // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing objectsetObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything

You mutated an existing `obj` object and passed it back to `setObj`, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always [_replacing_ objects and arrays in state instead of _mutating_ them](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

    // ✅ Correct: creating a new objectsetObj({  ...obj,  x: 10});

* * *

### I’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders”[](#im-getting-an-error-too-many-re-renders "Link for I’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” ")

You might get an error that says: `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.` Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state _during render_, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:

    // 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during renderreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handlerreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline functionreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>

If you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific `set` function call responsible for the error.

* * *

### My initializer or updater function runs twice[](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice "Link for My initializer or updater function runs twice ")

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:

    function TodoList() {  // This component function will run twice for every render.  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => {    // This initializer function will run twice during initialization.    return createTodos();  });  function handleClick() {    setTodos(prevTodos => {      // This updater function will run twice for every click.      return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];    });  }  // ...

This is expected and shouldn’t break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.

For example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:

    setTodos(prevTodos => {  // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state  prevTodos.push(createTodo());});

Because React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by [replacing the array instead of mutating it](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

    setTodos(prevTodos => {  // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state  return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];});

Now that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. **Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure.** Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

### I’m trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead[](#im-trying-to-set-state-to-a-function-but-it-gets-called-instead "Link for I’m trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead ")

You can’t put a function into state like this:

    const [fn, setFn] = useState(someFunction);function handleClick() {  setFn(someOtherFunction);}

Because you’re passing a function, React assumes that `someFunction` is an [initializer function](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state), and that `someOtherFunction` is an [updater function](#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state), so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually _store_ a function, you have to put `() =>` before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.

    const [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);function handleClick() {  setFn(() => someOtherFunction);}

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot?)`[](#usesyncexternalstore "Link for this heading")

Call `useSyncExternalStore` at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store.

    import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';import { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';function TodosApp() {  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);  // ...}

It returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments:

1.  The `subscribe` function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.
2.  The `getSnapshot` function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `subscribe`: A function that takes a single `callback` argument and subscribes it to the store. When the store changes, it should invoke the provided `callback`, which will cause React to re-call `getSnapshot` and (if needed) re-render the component. The `subscribe` function should return a function that cleans up the subscription.
    
*   `getSnapshot`: A function that returns a snapshot of the data in the store that’s needed by the component. While the store has not changed, repeated calls to `getSnapshot` must return the same value. If the store changes and the returned value is different (as compared by [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), React re-renders the component.
    
*   **optional** `getServerSnapshot`: A function that returns the initial snapshot of the data in the store. It will be used only during server rendering and during hydration of server-rendered content on the client. The server snapshot must be the same between the client and the server, and is usually serialized and passed from the server to the client. If you omit this argument, rendering the component on the server will throw an error.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

The current snapshot of the store which you can use in your rendering logic.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   The store snapshot returned by `getSnapshot` must be immutable. If the underlying store has mutable data, return a new immutable snapshot if the data has changed. Otherwise, return a cached last snapshot.
    
*   If a different `subscribe` function is passed during a re-render, React will re-subscribe to the store using the newly passed `subscribe` function. You can prevent this by declaring `subscribe` outside the component.
    
*   If the store is mutated during a [non-blocking Transition update](/reference/react/useTransition), React will fall back to performing that update as blocking. Specifically, for every Transition update, React will call `getSnapshot` a second time just before applying changes to the DOM. If it returns a different value than when it was called originally, React will restart the update from scratch, this time applying it as a blocking update, to ensure that every component on screen is reflecting the same version of the store.
    
*   It’s not recommended to _suspend_ a render based on a store value returned by `useSyncExternalStore`. The reason is that mutations to the external store cannot be marked as [non-blocking Transition updates](/reference/react/useTransition), so they will trigger the nearest [`Suspense` fallback](/reference/react/Suspense), replacing already-rendered content on screen with a loading spinner, which typically makes a poor UX.
    
    For example, the following are discouraged:
    
        const LazyProductDetailPage = lazy(() => import('./ProductDetailPage.js'));function ShoppingApp() {  const selectedProductId = useSyncExternalStore(...);  // ❌ Calling `use` with a Promise dependent on `selectedProductId`  const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId))  // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId`  return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> : <FeaturedProducts />;}
    

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Subscribing to an external store[](#subscribing-to-an-external-store "Link for Subscribing to an external store ")

Most of your React components will only read data from their [props,](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) [state,](/reference/react/useState) and [context.](/reference/react/useContext) However, sometimes a component needs to read some data from some store outside of React that changes over time. This includes:

*   Third-party state management libraries that hold state outside of React.
*   Browser APIs that expose a mutable value and events to subscribe to its changes.

Call `useSyncExternalStore` at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store.

    import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';import { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';function TodosApp() {  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);  // ...}

It returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments:

1.  The `subscribe` function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.
2.  The `getSnapshot` function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.

React will use these functions to keep your component subscribed to the store and re-render it on changes.

For example, in the sandbox below, `todosStore` is implemented as an external store that stores data outside of React. The `TodosApp` component connects to that external store with the `useSyncExternalStore` Hook.

        ))}
      </ul\>
    </\>
  );

### Note

When possible, we recommend using built-in React state with [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) and [`useReducer`](/reference/react/useReducer) instead. The `useSyncExternalStore` API is mostly useful if you need to integrate with existing non-React code.

* * *

### Subscribing to a browser API[](#subscribing-to-a-browser-api "Link for Subscribing to a browser API ")

Another reason to add `useSyncExternalStore` is when you want to subscribe to some value exposed by the browser that changes over time. For example, suppose that you want your component to display whether the network connection is active. The browser exposes this information via a property called [`navigator.onLine`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine)

This value can change without React’s knowledge, so you should read it with `useSyncExternalStore`.

    import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';function ChatIndicator() {  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);  // ...}

To implement the `getSnapshot` function, read the current value from the browser API:

    function getSnapshot() {  return navigator.onLine;}

Next, you need to implement the `subscribe` function. For example, when `navigator.onLine` changes, the browser fires the [`online`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/online_event) and [`offline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/offline_event) events on the `window` object. You need to subscribe the `callback` argument to the corresponding events, and then return a function that cleans up the subscriptions:

    function subscribe(callback) {  window.addEventListener('online', callback);  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);  return () => {    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);  };}

Now React knows how to read the value from the external `navigator.onLine` API and how to subscribe to its changes. Disconnect your device from the network and notice that the component re-renders in response:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

export default function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
  return <h1\>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1\>;
}

function getSnapshot() {
  return navigator.onLine;
}

function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () \=> {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}

### Extracting the logic to a custom Hook[](#extracting-the-logic-to-a-custom-hook "Link for Extracting the logic to a custom Hook ")

Usually you won’t write `useSyncExternalStore` directly in your components. Instead, you’ll typically call it from your own custom Hook. This lets you use the same external store from different components.

For example, this custom `useOnlineStatus` Hook tracks whether the network is online:

    import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';export function useOnlineStatus() {  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);  return isOnline;}function getSnapshot() {  // ...}function subscribe(callback) {  // ...}

Now different components can call `useOnlineStatus` without repeating the underlying implementation:

App.jsuseOnlineStatus.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';

function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1\>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1\>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled\={!isOnline} onClick\={handleSaveClick}\>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <\>
      <SaveButton />
      <StatusBar />
    </\>
  );
}

### Adding support for server rendering[](#adding-support-for-server-rendering "Link for Adding support for server rendering ")

If your React app uses [server rendering,](/reference/react-dom/server) your React components will also run outside the browser environment to generate the initial HTML. This creates a few challenges when connecting to an external store:

*   If you’re connecting to a browser-only API, it won’t work because it does not exist on the server.
*   If you’re connecting to a third-party data store, you’ll need its data to match between the server and client.

To solve these issues, pass a `getServerSnapshot` function as the third argument to `useSyncExternalStore`:

    import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';export function useOnlineStatus() {  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);  return isOnline;}function getSnapshot() {  return navigator.onLine;}function getServerSnapshot() {  return true; // Always show "Online" for server-generated HTML}function subscribe(callback) {  // ...}

The `getServerSnapshot` function is similar to `getSnapshot`, but it runs only in two situations:

*   It runs on the server when generating the HTML.
*   It runs on the client during [hydration](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot), i.e. when React takes the server HTML and makes it interactive.

This lets you provide the initial snapshot value which will be used before the app becomes interactive. If there is no meaningful initial value for the server rendering, omit this argument to [force rendering on the client.](/reference/react/Suspense#providing-a-fallback-for-server-errors-and-client-only-content)

### Note

Make sure that `getServerSnapshot` returns the same exact data on the initial client render as it returned on the server. For example, if `getServerSnapshot` returned some prepopulated store content on the server, you need to transfer this content to the client. One way to do this is to emit a `<script>` tag during server rendering that sets a global like `window.MY_STORE_DATA`, and read from that global on the client in `getServerSnapshot`. Your external store should provide instructions on how to do that.

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### I’m getting an error: “The result of `getSnapshot` should be cached”[](#im-getting-an-error-the-result-of-getsnapshot-should-be-cached "Link for this heading")

This error means your `getSnapshot` function returns a new object every time it’s called, for example:

    function getSnapshot() {  // 🔴 Do not return always different objects from getSnapshot  return {    todos: myStore.todos  };}

React will re-render the component if `getSnapshot` return value is different from the last time. This is why, if you always return a different value, you will enter an infinite loop and get this error.

Your `getSnapshot` object should only return a different object if something has actually changed. If your store contains immutable data, you can return that data directly:

    function getSnapshot() {  // ✅ You can return immutable data  return myStore.todos;}

If your store data is mutable, your `getSnapshot` function should return an immutable snapshot of it. This means it _does_ need to create new objects, but it shouldn’t do this for every single call. Instead, it should store the last calculated snapshot, and return the same snapshot as the last time if the data in the store has not changed. How you determine whether mutable data has changed depends on your mutable store.

* * *

### My `subscribe` function gets called after every re-render[](#my-subscribe-function-gets-called-after-every-re-render "Link for this heading")

This `subscribe` function is defined _inside_ a component so it is different on every re-render:

    function ChatIndicator() {  // 🚩 Always a different function, so React will resubscribe on every re-render  function subscribe() {    // ...  }    const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);  // ...}

React will resubscribe to your store if you pass a different `subscribe` function between re-renders. If this causes performance issues and you’d like to avoid resubscribing, move the `subscribe` function outside:

    // ✅ Always the same function, so React won't need to resubscribefunction subscribe() {  // ...}function ChatIndicator() {  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);  // ...}

Alternatively, wrap `subscribe` into [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) to only resubscribe when some argument changes:

    function ChatIndicator({ userId }) {  // ✅ Same function as long as userId doesn't change  const subscribe = useCallback(() => {    // ...  }, [userId]);    const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);  // ...}

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useTransition()`[](#usetransition "Link for this heading")

Call `useTransition` at the top level of your component to mark some state updates as Transitions.

    import { useTransition } from 'react';function TabContainer() {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  // ...}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`useTransition` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`useTransition` returns an array with exactly two items:

1.  The `isPending` flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.
2.  The [`startTransition` function](#starttransition) that lets you mark updates as a Transition.

* * *

### `startTransition(action)`[](#starttransition "Link for this heading")

The `startTransition` function returned by `useTransition` lets you mark an update as a Transition.

    function TabContainer() {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');  function selectTab(nextTab) {    startTransition(() => {      setTab(nextTab);    });  }  // ...}

### Note

#### Functions called in `startTransition` are called “Actions”.[](#functions-called-in-starttransition-are-called-actions "Link for this heading")

The function passed to `startTransition` is called an “Action”. By convention, any callback called inside `startTransition` (such as a callback prop) should be named `action` or include the “Action” suffix:

    function SubmitButton({ submitAction }) {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  return (    <button      disabled={isPending}      onClick={() => {        startTransition(async () => {          await submitAction();        });      }}    >      Submit    </button>  );}

#### Parameters[](#starttransition-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `action`: A function that updates some state by calling one or more [`set` functions](/reference/react/useState#setstate). React calls `action` immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the `action` function call as Transitions. Any async calls that are awaited in the `action` will be included in the Transition, but currently require wrapping any `set` functions after the `await` in an additional `startTransition` (see [Troubleshooting](#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)). State updates marked as Transitions will be [non-blocking](#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) and [will not display unwanted loading indicators](#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators).

#### Returns[](#starttransition-returns "Link for Returns ")

`startTransition` does not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#starttransition-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `useTransition` is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a Transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition) instead.
    
*   You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the `set` function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue) instead.
    
*   The function you pass to `startTransition` is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a `setTimeout`, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.
    
*   You must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another `startTransition` to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see [Troubleshooting](#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)).
    
*   The `startTransition` function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)
    
*   A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input update.
    
*   Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.
    
*   If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.
    

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Perform non-blocking updates with Actions[](#perform-non-blocking-updates-with-actions "Link for Perform non-blocking updates with Actions ")

Call `useTransition` at the top of your component to create Actions, and access the pending state:

    import {useState, useTransition} from 'react';function CheckoutForm() {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  // ...}

`useTransition` returns an array with exactly two items:

1.  The `isPending` flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.
2.  The `startTransition` function that lets you create an Action.

To start a Transition, pass a function to `startTransition` like this:

    import {useState, useTransition} from 'react';import {updateQuantity} from './api';function CheckoutForm() {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);  function onSubmit(newQuantity) {    startTransition(async function () {      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);      startTransition(() => {        setQuantity(savedQuantity);      });    });  }  // ...}

The function passed to `startTransition` is called the “Action”. You can update state and (optionally) perform side effects within an Action, and the work will be done in the background without blocking user interactions on the page. A Transition can include multiple Actions, and while a Transition is in progress, your UI stays responsive. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then changes their mind and clicks another tab, the second click will be immediately handled without waiting for the first update to finish.

To give the user feedback about in-progress Transitions, the `isPending` state switches to `true` at the first call to `startTransition`, and stays `true` until all Actions complete and the final state is shown to the user. Transitions ensure side effects in Actions to complete in order to [prevent unwanted loading indicators](#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators), and you can provide immediate feedback while the Transition is in progress with `useOptimistic`.

#### The difference between Actions and regular event handling[](#examples "Link for The difference between Actions and regular event handling")

1. Updating the quantity in an Action 2. Updating the quantity without an Action

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

Updating the quantity in an Action[](#updating-the-quantity-in-an-action "Link for this heading")

In this example, the `updateQuantity` function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function is _artificially slowed down_ so that it takes at least a second to complete the request.

Update the quantity multiple times quickly. Notice that the pending “Total” state is shown while any requests are in progress, and the “Total” updates only after the final request is complete. Because the update is in an Action, the “quantity” can continue to be updated while the request is in progress.

App.jsItem.jsTotal.jsapi.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useTransition } from "react";
import { updateQuantity } from "./api";
import Item from "./Item";
import Total from "./Total";

export default function App({}) {
  const \[quantity, setQuantity\] = useState(1);
  const \[isPending, startTransition\] = useTransition();

  const updateQuantityAction = async newQuantity \=> {
    // To access the pending state of a transition,
    // call startTransition again.
    startTransition(async () \=> {
      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);
      startTransition(() \=> {
        setQuantity(savedQuantity);
      });
    });
  };

  return (
    <div\>
      <h1\>Checkout</h1\>
      <Item action\={updateQuantityAction}/>
      <hr />
      <Total quantity\={quantity} isPending\={isPending} />
    </div\>
  );
}

This is a basic example to demonstrate how Actions work, but this example does not handle requests completing out of order. When updating the quantity multiple times, it’s possible for the previous requests to finish after later requests causing the quantity to update out of order. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see [Troubleshooting](#my-state-updates-in-transitions-are-out-of-order) below).

For common use cases, React provides built-in abstractions such as:

*   [`useActionState`](/reference/react/useActionState)
*   [`<form>` actions](/reference/react-dom/components/form)
*   [Server Functions](/reference/rsc/server-functions)

These solutions handle request ordering for you. When using Transitions to build your own custom hooks or libraries that manage async state transitions, you have greater control over the request ordering, but you must handle it yourself.

### Exposing `action` prop from components[](#exposing-action-props-from-components "Link for this heading")

You can expose an `action` prop from a component to allow a parent to call an Action.

For example, this `TabButton` component wraps its `onClick` logic in an `action` prop:

    export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  if (isActive) {    return <b>{children}</b>  }  return (    <button onClick={() => {      startTransition(async () => {        // await the action that's passed in.        // This allows it to be either sync or async.         await action();      });    }}>      {children}    </button>  );}

Because the parent component updates its state inside the `action`, that state update gets marked as a Transition. This means you can click on “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact” and it does not block user interactions:

App.jsTabButton.jsAboutTab.jsPostsTab.jsContactTab.js

TabButton.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useTransition } from 'react';

export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {
  const \[isPending, startTransition\] = useTransition();
  if (isActive) {
    return <b\>{children}</b\>
  }
  if (isPending) {
    return <b className\="pending"\>{children}</b\>;
  }
  return (
    <button onClick\={async () \=> {
      startTransition(async () \=> {
        // await the action that's passed in.
        // This allows it to be either sync or async. 
        await action();
      });
    }}\>
      {children}
    </button\>
  );
}

Show more

### Note

When exposing an `action` prop from a component, you should `await` it inside the transition.

This allows the `action` callback to be either synchronous or asynchronous without requiring an additional `startTransition` to wrap the `await` in the action.

* * *

### Displaying a pending visual state[](#displaying-a-pending-visual-state "Link for Displaying a pending visual state ")

You can use the `isPending` boolean value returned by `useTransition` to indicate to the user that a Transition is in progress. For example, the tab button can have a special “pending” visual state:

    function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  // ...  if (isPending) {    return <b className="pending">{children}</b>;  }  // ...

Notice how clicking “Posts” now feels more responsive because the tab button itself updates right away:

App.jsTabButton.jsAboutTab.jsPostsTab.jsContactTab.js

TabButton.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {

  if (isActive) {
    return <b\>{children}</b\>
  }
  if (isPending) {
    return <b className\="pending"\>{children}</b\>;
  }
  return (
    <button onClick\={() \=> {
      startTransition(async () \=> {
        await action();
      });
    }}\>
      {children}

### Preventing unwanted loading indicators[](#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators "Link for Preventing unwanted loading indicators ")

In this example, the `PostsTab` component fetches some data using [use](/reference/react/use). When you click the “Posts” tab, the `PostsTab` component _suspends_, causing the closest loading fallback to appear:

App.jsTabButton.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Suspense, useState } from 'react';
import TabButton from './TabButton.js';
import AboutTab from './AboutTab.js';
import PostsTab from './PostsTab.js';
import ContactTab from './ContactTab.js';

export default function TabContainer() {
  const \[tab, setTab\] = useState('about');
  return (
    <Suspense fallback\={<h1\>🌀 Loading...</h1\>}\>
      <TabButton
        isActive\={tab === 'about'}
        action\={() \=> setTab('about')}
      \>
        About
      </TabButton\>
      <TabButton
        isActive\={tab === 'posts'}
        action\={() \=> setTab('posts')}
      \>
        Posts
      </TabButton\>
      <TabButton
        isActive\={tab === 'contact'}
        action\={() \=> setTab('contact')}
      \>
        Contact
      </TabButton\>
      <hr />
      {tab === 'about' && <AboutTab />}
      {tab === 'posts' && <PostsTab />}
      {tab === 'contact' && <ContactTab />}
    </Suspense\>
  );
}

Hiding the entire tab container to show a loading indicator leads to a jarring user experience. If you add `useTransition` to `TabButton`, you can instead display the pending state in the tab button instead.

Notice that clicking “Posts” no longer replaces the entire tab container with a spinner:

App.jsTabButton.js

TabButton.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useTransition } from 'react';

export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {
  const \[isPending, startTransition\] = useTransition();
  if (isActive) {
    return <b\>{children}</b\>
  }
  if (isPending) {
    return <b className\="pending"\>{children}</b\>;
  }
  return (
    <button onClick\={() \=> {
      startTransition(async () \=> {
        await action();
      });
    }}\>
      {children}
    </button\>
  );
}

[Read more about using Transitions with Suspense.](/reference/react/Suspense#preventing-already-revealed-content-from-hiding)

### Note

Transitions only “wait” long enough to avoid hiding _already revealed_ content (like the tab container). If the Posts tab had a [nested `<Suspense>` boundary,](/reference/react/Suspense#revealing-nested-content-as-it-loads) the Transition would not “wait” for it.

### Building a Suspense-enabled router[](#building-a-suspense-enabled-router "Link for Building a Suspense-enabled router ")

If you’re building a React framework or a router, we recommend marking page navigations as Transitions.

    function Router() {  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  function navigate(url) {    startTransition(() => {      setPage(url);    });  }  // ...

This is recommended for three reasons:

*   [Transitions are interruptible,](#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) which lets the user click away without waiting for the re-render to complete.
*   [Transitions prevent unwanted loading indicators,](#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators) which lets the user avoid jarring jumps on navigation.
*   [Transitions wait for all pending actions](#perform-non-blocking-updates-with-actions) which lets the user wait for side effects to complete before the new page is shown.

Here is a simplified router example using Transitions for navigations.

App.jsLayout.jsIndexPage.jsArtistPage.jsAlbums.jsBiography.jsPanel.js

    </Suspense\>
  );
}

  const \[page, setPage\] = useState('/');
  const \[isPending, startTransition\] = useTransition();

### Displaying an error to users with an error boundary[](#displaying-an-error-to-users-with-error-boundary "Link for Displaying an error to users with an error boundary ")

If a function passed to `startTransition` throws an error, you can display an error to your user with an [error boundary](/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary). To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the `useTransition` in an error boundary. Once the function passed to `startTransition` errors, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Updating an input in a Transition doesn’t work[](#updating-an-input-in-a-transition-doesnt-work "Link for Updating an input in a Transition doesn’t work ")

You can’t use a Transition for a state variable that controls an input:

    const [text, setText] = useState('');// ...function handleChange(e) {  // ❌ Can't use Transitions for controlled input state  startTransition(() => {    setText(e.target.value);  });}// ...return <input value={text} onChange={handleChange} />;

This is because Transitions are non-blocking, but updating an input in response to the change event should happen synchronously. If you want to run a Transition in response to typing, you have two options:

1.  You can declare two separate state variables: one for the input state (which always updates synchronously), and one that you will update in a Transition. This lets you control the input using the synchronous state, and pass the Transition state variable (which will “lag behind” the input) to the rest of your rendering logic.
2.  Alternatively, you can have one state variable, and add [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue) which will “lag behind” the real value. It will trigger non-blocking re-renders to “catch up” with the new value automatically.

* * *

### React doesn’t treat my state update as a Transition[](#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-as-a-transition "Link for React doesn’t treat my state update as a Transition ")

When you wrap a state update in a Transition, make sure that it happens _during_ the `startTransition` call:

    startTransition(() => {  // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call  setPage('/about');});

The function you pass to `startTransition` must be synchronous. You can’t mark an update as a Transition like this:

    startTransition(() => {  // ❌ Setting state *after* startTransition call  setTimeout(() => {    setPage('/about');  }, 1000);});

Instead, you could do this:

    setTimeout(() => {  startTransition(() => {    // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call    setPage('/about');  });}, 1000);

* * *

### React doesn’t treat my state update after `await` as a Transition[](#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition "Link for this heading")

When you use `await` inside a `startTransition` function, the state updates that happen after the `await` are not marked as Transitions. You must wrap state updates after each `await` in a `startTransition` call:

    startTransition(async () => {  await someAsyncFunction();  // ❌ Not using startTransition after await  setPage('/about');});

However, this works instead:

    startTransition(async () => {  await someAsyncFunction();  // ✅ Using startTransition *after* await  startTransition(() => {    setPage('/about');  });});

This is a JavaScript limitation due to React losing the scope of the async context. In the future, when [AsyncContext](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context) is available, this limitation will be removed.

* * *

### I want to call `useTransition` from outside a component[](#i-want-to-call-usetransition-from-outside-a-component "Link for this heading")

You can’t call `useTransition` outside a component because it’s a Hook. In this case, use the standalone [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition) method instead. It works the same way, but it doesn’t provide the `isPending` indicator.

* * *

### The function I pass to `startTransition` executes immediately[](#the-function-i-pass-to-starttransition-executes-immediately "Link for this heading")

If you run this code, it will print 1, 2, 3:

    console.log(1);startTransition(() => {  console.log(2);  setPage('/about');});console.log(3);

**It is expected to print 1, 2, 3.** The function you pass to `startTransition` does not get delayed. Unlike with the browser `setTimeout`, it does not run the callback later. React executes your function immediately, but any state updates scheduled _while it is running_ are marked as Transitions. You can imagine that it works like this:

    // A simplified version of how React workslet isInsideTransition = false;function startTransition(scope) {  isInsideTransition = true;  scope();  isInsideTransition = false;}function setState() {  if (isInsideTransition) {    // ... schedule a Transition state update ...  } else {    // ... schedule an urgent state update ...  }}

### My state updates in Transitions are out of order[](#my-state-updates-in-transitions-are-out-of-order "Link for My state updates in Transitions are out of order ")

If you `await` inside `startTransition`, you might see the updates happen out of order.

In this example, the `updateQuantity` function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function _artificially returns the every other request after the previous_ to simulate race conditions for network requests.

Try updating the quantity once, then update it quickly multiple times. You might see the incorrect total:

App.jsItem.jsTotal.jsapi.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useTransition } from "react";
import { updateQuantity } from "./api";
import Item from "./Item";
import Total from "./Total";

export default function App({}) {
  const \[quantity, setQuantity\] = useState(1);
  const \[isPending, startTransition\] = useTransition();
  // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.
  const \[clientQuantity, setClientQuantity\] = useState(1);
  
  const updateQuantityAction = newQuantity \=> {
    setClientQuantity(newQuantity);

    // Access the pending state of the transition,
    // by wrapping in startTransition again.
    startTransition(async () \=> {
      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);
      startTransition(() \=> {
        setQuantity(savedQuantity);
      });
    });
  };

  return (
    <div\>
      <h1\>Checkout</h1\>
      <Item action\={updateQuantityAction}/>
      <hr />
      <Total clientQuantity\={clientQuantity} savedQuantity\={quantity} isPending\={isPending} />
    </div\>
  );
}

Show more

When clicking multiple times, it’s possible for previous requests to finish after later requests. When this happens, React currently has no way to know the intended order. This is because the updates are scheduled asynchronously, and React loses context of the order across the async boundary.

This is expected, because Actions within a Transition do not guarantee execution order. For common use cases, React provides higher-level abstractions like [`useActionState`](/reference/react/useActionState) and [`<form>` actions](/reference/react-dom/components/form) that handle ordering for you. For advanced use cases, you’ll need to implement your own queuing and abort logic to handle this.

Example of `useActionState` handling execution order:

App.jsItem.jsTotal.jsapi.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useActionState } from "react";
import { updateQuantity } from "./api";
import Item from "./Item";
import Total from "./Total";

export default function App({}) {
  // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.
  const \[clientQuantity, setClientQuantity\] = useState(1);
  const \[quantity, updateQuantityAction, isPending\] = useActionState(
    async (prevState, payload) \=> {
      setClientQuantity(payload);
      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(payload);
      return savedQuantity; // Return the new quantity to update the state
    },
    1 // Initial quantity
  );

  return (
    <div\>
      <h1\>Checkout</h1\>
      <Item action\={updateQuantityAction}/>
      <hr />
      <Total clientQuantity\={clientQuantity} savedQuantity\={quantity} isPending\={isPending} />
    </div\>

<Fragment> (<>...</>)[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===========================================================

`<Fragment>`, often used via `<>...</>` syntax, lets you group elements without a wrapper node.

    <>  <OneChild />  <AnotherChild /></>

    *   [Rendering a list of Fragments](#rendering-a-list-of-fragments)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<Fragment>`[](#fragment "Link for this heading")

Wrap elements in `<Fragment>` to group them together in situations where you need a single element. Grouping elements in `Fragment` has no effect on the resulting DOM; it is the same as if the elements were not grouped. The empty JSX tag `<></>` is shorthand for `<Fragment></Fragment>` in most cases.

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

*   **optional** `key`: Fragments declared with the explicit `<Fragment>` syntax may have [keys.](/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key)

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   If you want to pass `key` to a Fragment, you can’t use the `<>...</>` syntax. You have to explicitly import `Fragment` from `'react'` and render `<Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment>`.
    
*   React does not [reset state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) when you go from rendering `<><Child /></>` to `[<Child />]` or back, or when you go from rendering `<><Child /></>` to `<Child />` and back. This only works a single level deep: for example, going from `<><><Child /></></>` to `<Child />` resets the state. See the precise semantics [here.](https://gist.github.com/clemmy/b3ef00f9507909429d8aa0d3ee4f986b)
    

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Returning multiple elements[](#returning-multiple-elements "Link for Returning multiple elements ")

Use `Fragment`, or the equivalent `<>...</>` syntax, to group multiple elements together. You can use it to put multiple elements in any place where a single element can go. For example, a component can only return one element, but by using a Fragment you can group multiple elements together and then return them as a group:

    function Post() {  return (    <>      <PostTitle />      <PostBody />    </>  );}

Fragments are useful because grouping elements with a Fragment has no effect on layout or styles, unlike if you wrapped the elements in another container like a DOM element. If you inspect this example with the browser tools, you’ll see that all `<h1>` and `<article>` DOM nodes appear as siblings without wrappers around them:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function Blog() {
  return (
    <\>
      <Post title\="An update" body\="It's been a while since I posted..." />
      <Post title\="My new blog" body\="I am starting a new blog!" />
    </\>
  )
}

function Post({ title, body }) {
  return (
    <\>
      <PostTitle title\={title} />
      <PostBody body\={body} />
    </\>
  );
}

function PostTitle({ title }) {
  return <h1\>{title}</h1\>
}

function PostBody({ body }) {
  return (
    <article\>
      <p\>{body}</p\>
    </article\>
  );
}

##### Deep Dive

#### How to write a Fragment without the special syntax?[](#how-to-write-a-fragment-without-the-special-syntax "Link for How to write a Fragment without the special syntax? ")

Show Details

The example above is equivalent to importing `Fragment` from React:

    import { Fragment } from 'react';function Post() {  return (    <Fragment>      <PostTitle />      <PostBody />    </Fragment>  );}

Usually you won’t need this unless you need to [pass a `key` to your `Fragment`.](#rendering-a-list-of-fragments)

* * *

### Assigning multiple elements to a variable[](#assigning-multiple-elements-to-a-variable "Link for Assigning multiple elements to a variable ")

Like any other element, you can assign Fragment elements to variables, pass them as props, and so on:

    function CloseDialog() {  const buttons = (    <>      <OKButton />      <CancelButton />    </>  );  return (    <AlertDialog buttons={buttons}>      Are you sure you want to leave this page?    </AlertDialog>  );}

* * *

### Grouping elements with text[](#grouping-elements-with-text "Link for Grouping elements with text ")

You can use `Fragment` to group text together with components:

    function DateRangePicker({ start, end }) {  return (    <>      From      <DatePicker date={start} />      to      <DatePicker date={end} />    </>  );}

* * *

### Rendering a list of Fragments[](#rendering-a-list-of-fragments "Link for Rendering a list of Fragments ")

Here’s a situation where you need to write `Fragment` explicitly instead of using the `<></>` syntax. When you [render multiple elements in a loop](/learn/rendering-lists), you need to assign a `key` to each element. If the elements within the loop are Fragments, you need to use the normal JSX element syntax in order to provide the `key` attribute:

    function Blog() {  return posts.map(post =>    <Fragment key={post.id}>      <PostTitle title={post.title} />      <PostBody body={post.body} />    </Fragment>  );}

You can inspect the DOM to verify that there are no wrapper elements around the Fragment children:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Fragment } from 'react';

const posts = \[
  { id: 1, title: 'An update', body: "It's been a while since I posted..." },
  { id: 2, title: 'My new blog', body: 'I am starting a new blog!' }
\];

export default function Blog() {
  return posts.map(post \=>
    <Fragment key\={post.id}\>
      <PostTitle title\={post.title} />
      <PostBody body\={post.body} />
    </Fragment\>
  );
}

function PostTitle({ title }) {
  return <h1\>{title}</h1\>
}

function PostBody({ body }) {
  return (
    <article\>
      <p\>{body}</p\>
    </article\>
  );
}

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<Profiler>`[](#profiler "Link for this heading")

Wrap a component tree in a `<Profiler>` to measure its rendering performance.

    <Profiler id="App" onRender={onRender}>  <App /></Profiler>

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

*   `id`: A string identifying the part of the UI you are measuring.
*   `onRender`: An [`onRender` callback](#onrender-callback) that React calls every time components within the profiled tree update. It receives information about what was rendered and how much time it took.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Profiling adds some additional overhead, so **it is disabled in the production build by default.** To opt into production profiling, you need to enable a [special production build with profiling enabled.](https://fb.me/react-profiling)

* * *

### `onRender` callback[](#onrender-callback "Link for this heading")

React will call your `onRender` callback with information about what was rendered.

    function onRender(id, phase, actualDuration, baseDuration, startTime, commitTime) {  // Aggregate or log render timings...}

#### Parameters[](#onrender-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `id`: The string `id` prop of the `<Profiler>` tree that has just committed. This lets you identify which part of the tree was committed if you are using multiple profilers.
*   `phase`: `"mount"`, `"update"` or `"nested-update"`. This lets you know whether the tree has just been mounted for the first time or re-rendered due to a change in props, state, or Hooks.
*   `actualDuration`: The number of milliseconds spent rendering the `<Profiler>` and its descendants for the current update. This indicates how well the subtree makes use of memoization (e.g. [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) and [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo)). Ideally this value should decrease significantly after the initial mount as many of the descendants will only need to re-render if their specific props change.
*   `baseDuration`: The number of milliseconds estimating how much time it would take to re-render the entire `<Profiler>` subtree without any optimizations. It is calculated by summing up the most recent render durations of each component in the tree. This value estimates a worst-case cost of rendering (e.g. the initial mount or a tree with no memoization). Compare `actualDuration` against it to see if memoization is working.
*   `startTime`: A numeric timestamp for when React began rendering the current update.
*   `commitTime`: A numeric timestamp for when React committed the current update. This value is shared between all profilers in a commit, enabling them to be grouped if desirable.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Measuring rendering performance programmatically[](#measuring-rendering-performance-programmatically "Link for Measuring rendering performance programmatically ")

Wrap the `<Profiler>` component around a React tree to measure its rendering performance.

    <App>  <Profiler id="Sidebar" onRender={onRender}>    <Sidebar />  </Profiler>  <PageContent /></App>

It requires two props: an `id` (string) and an `onRender` callback (function) which React calls any time a component within the tree “commits” an update.

### Pitfall

Profiling adds some additional overhead, so **it is disabled in the production build by default.** To opt into production profiling, you need to enable a [special production build with profiling enabled.](https://fb.me/react-profiling)

### Note

`<Profiler>` lets you gather measurements programmatically. If you’re looking for an interactive profiler, try the Profiler tab in [React Developer Tools](/learn/react-developer-tools). It exposes similar functionality as a browser extension.

* * *

### Measuring different parts of the application[](#measuring-different-parts-of-the-application "Link for Measuring different parts of the application ")

You can use multiple `<Profiler>` components to measure different parts of your application:

    <App>  <Profiler id="Sidebar" onRender={onRender}>    <Sidebar />  </Profiler>  <Profiler id="Content" onRender={onRender}>    <Content />  </Profiler></App>

You can also nest `<Profiler>` components:

    <App>  <Profiler id="Sidebar" onRender={onRender}>    <Sidebar />  </Profiler>  <Profiler id="Content" onRender={onRender}>    <Content>      <Profiler id="Editor" onRender={onRender}>        <Editor />      </Profiler>      <Preview />    </Content>  </Profiler></App>

Although `<Profiler>` is a lightweight component, it should be used only when necessary. Each use adds some CPU and memory overhead to an application.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")

### `<StrictMode>`[](#strictmode "Link for this heading")

Use `StrictMode` to enable additional development behaviors and warnings for the component tree inside:

    import { StrictMode } from 'react';import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(  <StrictMode>    <App />  </StrictMode>);

[See more examples below.](#usage)

Strict Mode enables the following development-only behaviors:

*   Your components will [re-render an extra time](#fixing-bugs-found-by-double-rendering-in-development) to find bugs caused by impure rendering.
*   Your components will [re-run Effects an extra time](#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-effects-in-development) to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.
*   Your components will [re-run refs callbacks an extra time](#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-ref-callbacks-in-development) to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup.
*   Your components will [be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.](#fixing-deprecation-warnings-enabled-by-strict-mode)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`StrictMode` accepts no props.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   There is no way to opt out of Strict Mode inside a tree wrapped in `<StrictMode>`. This gives you confidence that all components inside `<StrictMode>` are checked. If two teams working on a product disagree whether they find the checks valuable, they need to either reach consensus or move `<StrictMode>` down in the tree.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Enabling Strict Mode for entire app[](#enabling-strict-mode-for-entire-app "Link for Enabling Strict Mode for entire app ")

Strict Mode enables extra development-only checks for the entire component tree inside the `<StrictMode>` component. These checks help you find common bugs in your components early in the development process.

To enable Strict Mode for your entire app, wrap your root component with `<StrictMode>` when you render it:

    import { StrictMode } from 'react';import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(  <StrictMode>    <App />  </StrictMode>);

We recommend wrapping your entire app in Strict Mode, especially for newly created apps. If you use a framework that calls [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot) for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode.

Although the Strict Mode checks **only run in development,** they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.

### Note

Strict Mode enables the following checks in development:

*   Your components will [re-render an extra time](#fixing-bugs-found-by-double-rendering-in-development) to find bugs caused by impure rendering.
*   Your components will [re-run Effects an extra time](#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-effects-in-development) to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.
*   Your components will [re-run ref callbacks an extra time](#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-ref-callbacks-in-development) to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup.
*   Your components will [be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.](#fixing-deprecation-warnings-enabled-by-strict-mode)

**All of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build.**

* * *

### Enabling Strict Mode for a part of the app[](#enabling-strict-mode-for-a-part-of-the-app "Link for Enabling Strict Mode for a part of the app ")

You can also enable Strict Mode for any part of your application:

    import { StrictMode } from 'react';function App() {  return (    <>      <Header />      <StrictMode>        <main>          <Sidebar />          <Content />        </main>      </StrictMode>      <Footer />    </>  );}

In this example, Strict Mode checks will not run against the `Header` and `Footer` components. However, they will run on `Sidebar` and `Content`, as well as all of the components inside them, no matter how deep.

### Note

When `StrictMode` is enabled for a part of the app, React will only enable behaviors that are possible in production. For example, if `<StrictMode>` is not enabled at the root of the app, it will not [re-run Effects an extra time](#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-effects-in-development) on initial mount, since this would cause child effects to double fire without the parent effects, which cannot happen in production.

### Fixing bugs found by double rendering in development[](#fixing-bugs-found-by-double-rendering-in-development "Link for Fixing bugs found by double rendering in development ")

[React assumes that every component you write is a pure function.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context).

Components breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) **twice in development.** This includes:

*   Your component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn’t include code inside event handlers)
*   Functions that you pass to [`useState`](/reference/react/useState), [`set` functions](/reference/react/useState#setstate), [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo), or [`useReducer`](/reference/react/useReducer)
*   Some class component methods like [`constructor`](/reference/react/Component#constructor), [`render`](/reference/react/Component#render), [`shouldComponentUpdate`](/reference/react/Component#shouldcomponentupdate) ([see the whole list](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects))

If a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that’s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.

**Here is an example to illustrate how double rendering in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.**

This `StoryTray` component takes an array of `stories` and adds one last “Create Story” item at the end:

index.jsApp.jsStoryTray.js

StoryTray.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  const items = stories;
  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });
  return (
    <ul\>
      {items.map(story \=> (
        <li key\={story.id}\>
          {story.label}
        </li\>
      ))}
    </ul\>
  );
}

There is a mistake in the code above. However, it is easy to miss because the initial output appears correct.

This mistake will become more noticeable if the `StoryTray` component re-renders multiple times. For example, let’s make the `StoryTray` re-render with a different background color whenever you hover over it:

index.jsApp.jsStoryTray.js

StoryTray.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  const \[isHover, setIsHover\] = useState(false);
  const items = stories;
  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });
  return (
    <ul
      onPointerEnter\={() \=> setIsHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave\={() \=> setIsHover(false)}
      style\={{
        backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff'
      }}
    \>
      {items.map(story \=> (
        <li key\={story.id}\>
          {story.label}
        </li\>
      ))}
    </ul\>
  );
}

Notice how every time you hover over the `StoryTray` component, “Create Story” gets added to the list again. The intention of the code was to add it once at the end. But `StoryTray` directly modifies the `stories` array from the props. Every time `StoryTray` renders, it adds “Create Story” again at the end of the same array. In other words, `StoryTray` is not a pure function—running it multiple times produces different results.

To fix this problem, you can make a copy of the array, and modify that copy instead of the original one:

    export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array  // ✅ Good: Pushing into a new array  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });

This would [make the `StoryTray` function pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) Each time it is called, it would only modify a new copy of the array, and would not affect any external objects or variables. This solves the bug, but you had to make the component re-render more often before it became obvious that something is wrong with its behavior.

**In the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in `<StrictMode>`:**

index.jsApp.jsStoryTray.js

StoryTray.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function StoryTray({ stories }) {
  const items = stories;
  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });
  return (
    <ul\>
      {items.map(story \=> (
        <li key\={story.id}\>
          {story.label}
        </li\>
      ))}
    </ul\>
  );
}

**Strict Mode _always_ calls your rendering function twice, so you can see the mistake right away** (“Create Story” appears twice). This lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your component to render in Strict Mode, you _also_ fix many possible future production bugs like the hover functionality from before:

        <li key\={story.id}\>

        </li\>

Without Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you added more re-renders. Strict Mode made the same bug appear right away. Strict Mode helps you find bugs before you push them to your team and to your users.

### Fixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development[](#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-effects-in-development "Link for Fixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development ")

Strict Mode can also help find bugs in [Effects.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

Every Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component _mounts_ (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component _unmounts_ (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render.

When Strict Mode is on, React will also run **one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect.** This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.

**Here is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.**

Consider this example that connects a component to a chat:

index.jsApp.jschat.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './styles.css';

import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);

There is an issue with this code, but it might not be immediately clear.

To make the issue more obvious, let’s implement a feature. In the example below, `roomId` is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the `roomId` that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console:

index.jsApp.jschat.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './styles.css';

import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);

You’ll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that [your Effect is missing a cleanup function:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed)

      useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => connection.disconnect();  }, [roomId]);

Now that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved. However, notice that the problem did not become visible until you’ve added more features (the select box).

**In the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in `<StrictMode>`:**

index.jsApp.jschat.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './styles.css';

import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <StrictMode\>
    <App />
  </StrictMode\>
);

**With Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem** (the number of active connections jumps to 2). Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every Effect. This Effect has no cleanup logic, so it creates an extra connection but doesn’t destroy it. This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function.

Strict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you _also_ fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before:

index.jsApp.jschat.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './styles.css';

import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <StrictMode\>
    <App />
  </StrictMode\>
);

Notice how the active connection count in the console doesn’t keep growing anymore.

Without Strict Mode, it was easy to miss that your Effect needed cleanup. By running _setup → cleanup → setup_ instead of _setup_ for your Effect in development, Strict Mode made the missing cleanup logic more noticeable.

### Fixing bugs found by re-running ref callbacks in development[](#fixing-bugs-found-by-re-running-ref-callbacks-in-development "Link for Fixing bugs found by re-running ref callbacks in development ")

Strict Mode can also help find bugs in [callbacks refs.](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs)

Every callback `ref` has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the element is _created_ (is added to the DOM) and calls cleanup when the element is _removed_ (is removed from the DOM).

When Strict Mode is on, React will also run **one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every callback `ref`.** This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.

Consider this example, which allows you to select an animal and then scroll to one of them. Notice when you switch from “Cats” to “Dogs”, the console logs show that the number of animals in the list keeps growing, and the “Scroll to” buttons stop working:

**This is a production bug!** Since the ref callback doesn’t remove animals from the list in the cleanup, the list of animals keeps growing. This is a memory leak that can cause performance problems in a real app, and breaks the behavior of the app.

The issue is the ref callback doesn’t cleanup after itself:

    <li  ref={node => {    const list = itemsRef.current;    const item = {animal, node};    list.push(item);    return () => {      // 🚩 No cleanup, this is a bug!    }  }}</li>

Now on inital mount in StrictMode, the ref callbacks are all setup, cleaned up, and setup again:

    ...✅ Adding animal to the map. Total animals: 10...❌ Removing animal from the map. Total animals: 0...✅ Adding animal to the map. Total animals: 10

**This is expected.** Strict Mode confirms that the ref callbacks are cleaned up correctly, so the size never grows above the expected amount. After the fix, there are no memory leaks, and all the features work as expected.

Without Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you clicked around to app to notice broken features. Strict Mode made the bugs appear right away, before you push them to production.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<Suspense>`[](#suspense "Link for this heading")

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

*   `children`: The actual UI you intend to render. If `children` suspends while rendering, the Suspense boundary will switch to rendering `fallback`.
*   `fallback`: An alternate UI to render in place of the actual UI if it has not finished loading. Any valid React node is accepted, though in practice, a fallback is a lightweight placeholder view, such as a loading spinner or skeleton. Suspense will automatically switch to `fallback` when `children` suspends, and back to `children` when the data is ready. If `fallback` suspends while rendering, it will activate the closest parent Suspense boundary.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   React does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time. When the component has loaded, React will retry rendering the suspended tree from scratch.
*   If Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the `fallback` will be shown again unless the update causing it was caused by [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition) or [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue).
*   If React needs to hide the already visible content because it suspended again, it will clean up [layout Effects](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) in the content tree. When the content is ready to be shown again, React will fire the layout Effects again. This ensures that Effects measuring the DOM layout don’t try to do this while the content is hidden.
*   React includes under-the-hood optimizations like _Streaming Server Rendering_ and _Selective Hydration_ that are integrated with Suspense. Read [an architectural overview](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37) and watch [a technical talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj5N-Khihgc) to learn more.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Displaying a fallback while content is loading[](#displaying-a-fallback-while-content-is-loading "Link for Displaying a fallback while content is loading ")

You can wrap any part of your application with a Suspense boundary:

    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>  <Albums /></Suspense>

React will display your loading fallback until all the code and data needed by the children has been loaded.

In the example below, the `Albums` component _suspends_ while fetching the list of albums. Until it’s ready to render, React switches the closest Suspense boundary above to show the fallback—your `Loading` component. Then, when the data loads, React hides the `Loading` fallback and renders the `Albums` component with data.

ArtistPage.jsAlbums.js

ArtistPage.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Suspense } from 'react';
import Albums from './Albums.js';

export default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {
  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>{artist.name}</h1\>
      <Suspense fallback\={<Loading />}\>
        <Albums artistId\={artist.id} />
      </Suspense\>
    </\>
  );
}

function Loading() {
  return <h2\>🌀 Loading...</h2\>;
}

### Note

**Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component.** They include:

*   Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense)
*   Lazy-loading component code with [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy)
*   Reading the value of a cached Promise with [`use`](/reference/react/use)

Suspense **does not** detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.

The exact way you would load data in the `Albums` component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.

Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.

* * *

### Revealing content together at once[](#revealing-content-together-at-once "Link for Revealing content together at once ")

By default, the whole tree inside Suspense is treated as a single unit. For example, even if _only one_ of these components suspends waiting for some data, _all_ of them together will be replaced by the loading indicator:

    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>  <Biography />  <Panel>    <Albums />  </Panel></Suspense>

Then, after all of them are ready to be displayed, they will all appear together at once.

In the example below, both `Biography` and `Albums` fetch some data. However, because they are grouped under a single Suspense boundary, these components always “pop in” together at the same time.

ArtistPage.jsPanel.jsBiography.jsAlbums.js

ArtistPage.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Suspense } from 'react';
import Albums from './Albums.js';
import Biography from './Biography.js';
import Panel from './Panel.js';

export default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {
  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>{artist.name}</h1\>
      <Suspense fallback\={<Loading />}\>
        <Biography artistId\={artist.id} />
        <Panel\>
          <Albums artistId\={artist.id} />
        </Panel\>
      </Suspense\>
    </\>
  );
}

function Loading() {
  return <h2\>🌀 Loading...</h2\>;
}

Show more

Components that load data don’t have to be direct children of the Suspense boundary. For example, you can move `Biography` and `Albums` into a new `Details` component. This doesn’t change the behavior. `Biography` and `Albums` share the same closest parent Suspense boundary, so their reveal is coordinated together.

    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>  <Details artistId={artist.id} /></Suspense>function Details({ artistId }) {  return (    <>      <Biography artistId={artistId} />      <Panel>        <Albums artistId={artistId} />      </Panel>    </>  );}

* * *

### Revealing nested content as it loads[](#revealing-nested-content-as-it-loads "Link for Revealing nested content as it loads ")

When a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense component shows the fallback. This lets you nest multiple Suspense components to create a loading sequence. Each Suspense boundary’s fallback will be filled in as the next level of content becomes available. For example, you can give the album list its own fallback:

    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>  <Biography />  <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>    <Panel>      <Albums />    </Panel>  </Suspense></Suspense>

With this change, displaying the `Biography` doesn’t need to “wait” for the `Albums` to load.

The sequence will be:

1.  If `Biography` hasn’t loaded yet, `BigSpinner` is shown in place of the entire content area.
2.  Once `Biography` finishes loading, `BigSpinner` is replaced by the content.
3.  If `Albums` hasn’t loaded yet, `AlbumsGlimmer` is shown in place of `Albums` and its parent `Panel`.
4.  Finally, once `Albums` finishes loading, it replaces `AlbumsGlimmer`.

Suspense boundaries let you coordinate which parts of your UI should always “pop in” together at the same time, and which parts should progressively reveal more content in a sequence of loading states. You can add, move, or delete Suspense boundaries in any place in the tree without affecting the rest of your app’s behavior.

Don’t put a Suspense boundary around every component. Suspense boundaries should not be more granular than the loading sequence that you want the user to experience. If you work with a designer, ask them where the loading states should be placed—it’s likely that they’ve already included them in their design wireframes.

### Showing stale content while fresh content is loading[](#showing-stale-content-while-fresh-content-is-loading "Link for Showing stale content while fresh content is loading ")

In this example, the `SearchResults` component suspends while fetching the search results. Type `"a"`, wait for the results, and then edit it to `"ab"`. The results for `"a"` will get replaced by the loading fallback.

App.jsSearchResults.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Suspense, useState } from 'react';
import SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';

export default function App() {
  const \[query, setQuery\] = useState('');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Search albums:
        <input value\={query} onChange\={e \=> setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Suspense fallback\={<h2\>Loading...</h2\>}\>
        <SearchResults query\={query} />
      </Suspense\>
    </\>
  );
}

Show more

A common alternative UI pattern is to _defer_ updating the list and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. The [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue) Hook lets you pass a deferred version of the query down:

    export default function App() {  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);  return (    <>      <label>        Search albums:        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />      </label>      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />      </Suspense>    </>  );}

The `query` will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the `deferredQuery` will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so `SearchResults` will show the stale results for a bit.

To make it more obvious to the user, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:

    <div style={{  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1 }}>  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} /></div>

Enter `"a"` in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to `"ab"`. Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the dimmed stale result list until the new results have loaded:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';
import SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';

export default function App() {
  const \[query, setQuery\] = useState('');
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Search albums:
        <input value\={query} onChange\={e \=> setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Suspense fallback\={<h2\>Loading...</h2\>}\>
        <div style\={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1 }}\>
          <SearchResults query\={deferredQuery} />
        </div\>
      </Suspense\>
    </\>
  );
}

### Note

Both deferred values and [Transitions](#preventing-already-revealed-content-from-hiding) let you avoid showing Suspense fallback in favor of inline indicators. Transitions mark the whole update as non-urgent so they are typically used by frameworks and router libraries for navigation. Deferred values, on the other hand, are mostly useful in application code where you want to mark a part of UI as non-urgent and let it “lag behind” the rest of the UI.

### Preventing already revealed content from hiding[](#preventing-already-revealed-content-from-hiding "Link for Preventing already revealed content from hiding ")

When a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense boundary switches to showing the fallback. This can lead to a jarring user experience if it was already displaying some content. Try pressing this button:

App.jsLayout.jsIndexPage.jsArtistPage.jsAlbums.jsBiography.jsPanel.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';
import ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';
import Layout from './Layout.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback\={<BigSpinner />}\>
      <Router />
    </Suspense\>
  );
}

function Router() {
  const \[page, setPage\] = useState('/');

  function navigate(url) {
    setPage(url);
  }

  let content;
  if (page === '/') {
    content = (
      <IndexPage navigate\={navigate} />
    );
  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {
    content = (
      <ArtistPage
        artist\={{
          id: 'the-beatles',
          name: 'The Beatles',
        }}
      />
    );
  }
  return (
    <Layout\>
      {content}
    </Layout\>
  );
}

function BigSpinner() {
  return <h2\>🌀 Loading...</h2\>;
}

When you pressed the button, the `Router` component rendered `ArtistPage` instead of `IndexPage`. A component inside `ArtistPage` suspended, so the closest Suspense boundary started showing the fallback. The closest Suspense boundary was near the root, so the whole site layout got replaced by `BigSpinner`.

To prevent this, you can mark the navigation state update as a _Transition_ with [`startTransition`:](/reference/react/startTransition)

    function Router() {  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');  function navigate(url) {    startTransition(() => {      setPage(url);          });  }  // ...

This tells React that the state transition is not urgent, and it’s better to keep showing the previous page instead of hiding any already revealed content. Now clicking the button “waits” for the `Biography` to load:

App.jsLayout.jsIndexPage.jsArtistPage.jsAlbums.jsBiography.jsPanel.js

      <Router />
    </Suspense\>
  );
}

function Router() {
  const \[page, setPage\] = useState('/');

  function navigate(url) {
    startTransition(() \=> {
      setPage(url);
    });
  }

  let content;
  if (page === '/') {
    content = (
      <IndexPage navigate\={navigate} />
    );
  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {
    content = (
      <ArtistPage
        artist\={{
          id: 'the-beatles',
          name: 'The Beatles',
        }}
      />
    );
  }
  return (
    <Layout\>
      {content}
    </Layout\>
  );
}

function BigSpinner() {
  return <h2\>🌀 Loading...</h2\>;
}

Show more

A Transition doesn’t wait for _all_ content to load. It only waits long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content. For example, the website `Layout` was already revealed, so it would be bad to hide it behind a loading spinner. However, the nested `Suspense` boundary around `Albums` is new, so the Transition doesn’t wait for it.

### Note

Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.

### Indicating that a Transition is happening[](#indicating-that-a-transition-is-happening "Link for Indicating that a Transition is happening ")

In the above example, once you click the button, there is no visual indication that a navigation is in progress. To add an indicator, you can replace [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition) with [`useTransition`](/reference/react/useTransition) which gives you a boolean `isPending` value. In the example below, it’s used to change the website header styling while a Transition is happening:

    </Suspense\>
  );
}

  const \[page, setPage\] = useState('/');
  const \[isPending, startTransition\] = useTransition();

      setPage(url);
    });
  }

  let content;
  if (page === '/') {
    content = (
      <IndexPage navigate\={navigate} />
    );
  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {
    content = (
      <ArtistPage
        artist\={{
          id: 'the-beatles',
          name: 'The Beatles',

### Resetting Suspense boundaries on navigation[](#resetting-suspense-boundaries-on-navigation "Link for Resetting Suspense boundaries on navigation ")

During a Transition, React will avoid hiding already revealed content. However, if you navigate to a route with different parameters, you might want to tell React it is _different_ content. You can express this with a `key`:

    <ProfilePage key={queryParams.id} />

Imagine you’re navigating within a user’s profile page, and something suspends. If that update is wrapped in a Transition, it will not trigger the fallback for already visible content. That’s the expected behavior.

However, now imagine you’re navigating between two different user profiles. In that case, it makes sense to show the fallback. For example, one user’s timeline is _different content_ from another user’s timeline. By specifying a `key`, you ensure that React treats different users’ profiles as different components, and resets the Suspense boundaries during navigation. Suspense-integrated routers should do this automatically.

* * *

### Providing a fallback for server errors and client-only content[](#providing-a-fallback-for-server-errors-and-client-only-content "Link for Providing a fallback for server errors and client-only content ")

If you use one of the [streaming server rendering APIs](/reference/react-dom/server) (or a framework that relies on them), React will also use your `<Suspense>` boundaries to handle errors on the server. If a component throws an error on the server, React will not abort the server render. Instead, it will find the closest `<Suspense>` component above it and include its fallback (such as a spinner) into the generated server HTML. The user will see a spinner at first.

On the client, React will attempt to render the same component again. If it errors on the client too, React will throw the error and display the closest [error boundary.](/reference/react/Component#static-getderivedstatefromerror) However, if it does not error on the client, React will not display the error to the user since the content was eventually displayed successfully.

You can use this to opt out some components from rendering on the server. To do this, throw an error in the server environment and then wrap them in a `<Suspense>` boundary to replace their HTML with fallbacks:

    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>  <Chat /></Suspense>function Chat() {  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {    throw Error('Chat should only render on the client.');  }  // ...}

The server HTML will include the loading indicator. It will be replaced by the `Chat` component on the client.

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### How do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update?[](#preventing-unwanted-fallbacks "Link for How do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update? ")

Replacing visible UI with a fallback creates a jarring user experience. This can happen when an update causes a component to suspend, and the nearest Suspense boundary is already showing content to the user.

To prevent this from happening, [mark the update as non-urgent using `startTransition`](#preventing-already-revealed-content-from-hiding). During a Transition, React will wait until enough data has loaded to prevent an unwanted fallback from appearing:

    function handleNextPageClick() {  // If this update suspends, don't hide the already displayed content  startTransition(() => {    setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1);  });}

This will avoid hiding existing content. However, any newly rendered `Suspense` boundaries will still immediately display fallbacks to avoid blocking the UI and let the user see the content as it becomes available.

**React will only prevent unwanted fallbacks during non-urgent updates**. It will not delay a render if it’s the result of an urgent update. You must opt in with an API like [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition) or [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue).

If your router is integrated with Suspense, it should wrap its updates into [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition) automatically.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<Activity>`[](#activity "Link for this heading")

Wrap a part of the UI in `<Activity>` to manage its visibility state:

    import {unstable_Activity as Activity} from 'react';<Activity mode={isVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>  <Page /></Activity>

When “hidden”, the `children` of `<Activity />` are not visible on the page. If a new `<Activity>` mounts as “hidden” then it pre-renders the content at lower priority without blocking the visible content on the page, but it does not mount by creating Effects. When a “visible” Activity switches to “hidden” it conceptually unmounts by destroying all the Effects, but saves its state. This allows fast switching between “visible” and “hidden” states without recreating the state for a “hidden” Activity.

In the future, “hidden” Activities may automatically destroy state based on resources like memory.

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

*   `children`: The actual UI you intend to render.
*   **optional** `mode`: Either “visible” or “hidden”. Defaults to “visible”. When “hidden”, updates to the children are deferred to lower priority. The component will not create Effects until the Activity is switched to “visible”. If a “visible” Activity switches to “hidden”, the Effects will be destroyed.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   While hidden, the `children` of `<Activity>` are hidden on the page.
*   `<Activity>` will unmount all Effects when switching from “visible” to “hidden” without destroying React or DOM state. This means Effects that are expected to run only once on mount will run again when switching from “hidden” to “visible”. Conceptually, “hidden” Activities are unmounted, but they are not destroyed either. We recommend using [`<StrictMode>`](/reference/react/StrictMode) to catch any unexpected side-effects from this behavior.
*   When used with `<ViewTransition>`, hidden activities that reveal in a transition will activate an “enter” animation. Visible Activities hidden in a transition will activate an “exit” animation.
*   Parts of the UI wrapped in `<Activity mode="hidden">` are not included in the SSR response.
*   Parts of the UI wrapped in `<Activity mode="visible">` will hydrate at a lower priority than other content.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Pre-render part of the UI[](#pre-render-part-of-the-ui "Link for Pre-render part of the UI ")

You can pre-render part of the UI using `<Activity mode="hidden">`:

    <Activity mode={tab === "posts" ? "visible" : "hidden"}>  <PostsTab /></Activity>

When an Activity is rendered with `mode="hidden"`, the `children` are not visible on the page, but are rendered at lower priority than the visible content on the page.

When the `mode` later switches to “visible”, the pre-rendered children will mount and become visible. This can be used to prepare parts of the UI the user is likely to interact with next to reduce loading times.

In the following example from [`useTransition`](/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators), the `PostsTab` component fetches some data using `use`. When you click the “Posts” tab, the `PostsTab` component suspends, causing the button loading state to appear:

In this example, the user needs to wait for the posts to load when clicking on the “Posts” tab.

We can reduce the delay for the “Posts” tab by pre-rendering the inactive Tabs with a hidden `<Activity>`:

### Keeping state for part of the UI[](#keeping-state-for-part-of-the-ui "Link for Keeping state for part of the UI ")

You can keep state for parts of the UI by switching `<Activity>` from “visible” to “hidden”:

    <Activity mode={tab === "posts" ? "visible" : "hidden"}>  <PostsTab /></Activity>

When an Activity switches from `mode="visible"` to “hidden”, the `children` will become hidden on the page, and unmount by destroying all Effects, but will keep their React and DOM state.

When the `mode` later switches to “visible”, the saved state will be re-used when mounting the children by creating all the Effects. This can be used to keep state in parts of the UI the user is likely to interact with again to maintain DOM or React state.

In the following example from [`useTransition`](/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators), the `ContactTab` includes a `<textarea>` with a draft message to send. If you enter some text and change to a different tab, then when you click the “Contact” tab again, the draft message is lost:

This results in losing DOM state the user has input. We can keep the state for the Contact tab by hiding the inactive Tabs with `<Activity>`:

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Effects don’t mount when an Activity is hidden[](#effects-dont-mount-when-an-activity-is-hidden "Link for Effects don’t mount when an Activity is hidden ")

When an `<Activity>` is “hidden”, all Effects are unmounted. Conceptually, the component is unmounted, but React saves the state for later.

This is a feature of Activity because it means subscriptions won’t be subscribed for hidden parts of the UI, reducing the amount of work for hidden content. It also means cleanup, such as pausing a video (which would be expected if you unmounted without Activity) will fire. When an Activity switches to “visible”, it will mount by creating the Effects, which will subscribe and play the video.

Consider the following example, where a different video is played for each button:

App.js

  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() \=> {
    const videoRef = ref.current;
    videoRef.play();
    
    return () \=> {
      videoRef.pause();
    }
  }, \[\]);

  return <video ref\={ref} src\={src} muted loop playsInline/>;

Whenever you change videos and come back, the video re-loads from the beginning. To maintain the state, you may try to render both videos, and hide the inactive video in `display: none`. However, this will cause both videos to play at the same time:

This is similar to what would happen if Activity mounted Effects when hidden. Similarly, if Activity didn’t unmount Effects when hiding, the videos would continue to play in the background.

Activity solves this by not creating Effects when first rendered as “hidden” and destroying all Effects when switching from “visible” to “hidden”:

For this reason, it’s best to think of Activity conceptually as “unmounting” and “remounting” the component, but saving the React or DOM state for later. In practice, this works as expected if you have followed the [You Might Not Need an Effect](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) guide. To eagerly find problematic Effects, we recommend adding [`<StrictMode>`](/reference/react/StrictMode) which will eagerly perform Activity unmounts and mounts to catch any unexpected side-effects.

### My hidden Activity is not rendered in SSR[](#my-hidden-activity-is-not-rendered-in-ssr "Link for My hidden Activity is not rendered in SSR ")

When you use `<Activity mode="hidden">` during server-side rendering, the content of the Activity will not be included in the SSR response. This is because the content is not visible on the page and is not needed for the initial render. If you need to include the content in the SSR response, you can use a different approach like [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue) to defer rendering of the content.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<ViewTransition>`[](#viewtransition "Link for this heading")

Wrap elements in `<ViewTransition>` to animate them when they update inside a [Transition](/reference/react/useTransition). React uses the following heuristics to determine if a View Transition activates for an animation:

*   `enter`: If a `ViewTransition` itself gets inserted in this Transition, then this will activate.
*   `exit`: If a `ViewTransition` itself gets deleted in this Transition, then this will activate.
*   `update`: If a `ViewTransition` has any DOM mutations inside it that React is doing (such as a prop changing) or if the `ViewTransition` boundary itself changes size or position due to an immediate sibling. If there are nested `ViewTransition` then the mutation applies to them and not the parent.
*   `share`: If a named `ViewTransition` is inside a deleted subtree and another named `ViewTransition` with the same name is part of an inserted subtree in the same Transition, they form a Shared Element Transition, and it animates from the deleted one to the inserted one.

By default, `<ViewTransition>` animates with a smooth cross-fade (the browser default view transition). You can customize the animation by providing a [View Transition Class](#view-transition-class) to the `<ViewTransition>` component. You can customize animations for each kind of trigger (see [Styling View Transitions](#styling-view-transitions)).

##### Deep Dive

#### How does `<ViewTransition>` work?[](#how-does-viewtransition-work "Link for this heading")

Show Details

Under the hood, React applies `view-transition-name` to inline styles of the nearest DOM node nested inside the `<ViewTransition>` component. If there are multiple sibling DOM nodes like `<ViewTransition><div /><div /></ViewTransition>` then React adds a suffix to the name to make each unique but conceptually they’re part of the same one. React doesn’t apply these eagerly but only at the time that boundary should participate in an animation.

React automatically calls `startViewTransition` itself behind the scenes so you should never do that yourself. In fact, if you have something else on the page running a ViewTransition React will interrupt it. So it’s recommended that you use React itself to coordinate these. If you had other ways of trigger ViewTransitions in the past, we recommend that you migrate to the built-in way.

If there are other React ViewTransitions already running then React will wait for them to finish before starting the next one. However, importantly if there are multiple updates happening while the first one is running, those will all be batched into one. If you start A->B. Then in the meantime you get an update to go to C and then D. When the first A->B animation finishes the next one will animate from B->D.

The `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` life-cycle will be called before `startViewTransition` and some `view-transition-name` will update at the same time.

Then React calls `startViewTransition`. Inside the `updateCallback`, React will:

*   Apply its mutations to the DOM and invoke useInsertionEffects.
*   Wait for fonts to load.
*   Call componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, useLayoutEffect and refs.
*   Wait for any pending Navigation to finish.
*   Then React will measure any changes to the layout to see which boundaries will need to animate.

After the ready Promise of the `startViewTransition` is resolved, React will then revert the `view-transition-name`. Then React will invoke the `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onUpdate` and `onShare` callbacks to allow for manual programmatic control over the Animations. This will be after the built-in default ones have already been computed.

If a `flushSync` happens to get in the middle of this sequence, then React will skip the Transition since it relies on being able to complete synchronously.

After the finished Promise of the `startViewTransition` is resolved, React will then invoke `useEffect`. This prevents those from interfering with the performance of the Animation. However, this is not a guarantee because if another `setState` happens while the Animation is running it’ll still have to invoke the `useEffect` earlier to preserve the sequential guarantees.

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

By default, `<ViewTransition>` animates with a smooth cross-fade. You can customize the animation, or specify a shared element transition, with these props:

*   **optional** `enter`: A string or object. The [View Transition Class](#view-transition-class) to apply when enter is activated.
*   **optional** `exit`: A string or object. The [View Transition Class](#view-transition-class) to apply when exit is activated.
*   **optional** `update`: A string or object. The [View Transition Class](#view-transition-class) to apply when an update is activated.
*   **optional** `share`: A string or object. The [View Transition Class](#view-transition-class) to apply when a shared element is activated.
*   **optional** `default`: A string or object. The [View Transition Class](#view-transition-class) used when no other matching activation prop is found.
*   **optional** `name`: A string or object. The name of the View Transition used for shared element transitions. If not provided, React will use a unique name for each View Transition to prevent unexpected animations.

#### Callback[](#events "Link for Callback ")

These callbacks allow you to adjust the animation imperatively using the [animate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animate) APIs:

*   **optional** `onEnter`: A function. React calls `onEnter` after an “enter” animation.
*   **optional** `onExit`: A function. React calls `onExit` after an “exit” animation.
*   **optional** `onShare`: A function. React calls `onShare` after a “share” animation.
*   **optional** `onUpdate`: A function. React calls `onUpdate` after an “update” animation.

Each callback receives as arguments:

*   `element`: The DOM element that was animated.
*   `types`: The [Transition Types](/reference/react/addTransitionType) included in the animation.

### View Transition Class[](#view-transition-class "Link for View Transition Class ")

The View Transition Class is the CSS class name(s) applied by React during the transition when the ViewTransition activates. It can be a string or an object.

*   `string`: the `class` added on the child elements when activated. If `'none'` is provided, no class will be added.
*   `object`: the class added on the child elements will be the key matching View Transition type added with `addTransitionType`. The object can also specify a `default` to use if no matching type is found.

The value `'none'` can be used to prevent a View Transition from activating for a specific trigger.

### Styling View Transitions[](#styling-view-transitions "Link for Styling View Transitions ")

### Note

In many early examples of View Transitions around the web, you’ll have seen using a [`view-transition-name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/view-transition-name) and then style it using `::view-transition-...(my-name)` selectors. We don’t recommend that for styling. Instead, we normally recommend using a View Transition Class instead.

To customize the animation for a `<ViewTransition>` you can provide a View Transition Class to one of the activation props. The View Transition Class is a CSS class name that React applies to the child elements when the ViewTransition activates.

For example, to customize an “enter” animation, provide a class name to the `enter` prop:

    <ViewTransition enter="slide-in">

When the `<ViewTransition>` activates an “enter” animation, React will add the class name `slide-in`. Then you can refer to this class using [view transition pseudo selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#pseudo-elements) to build reusable animations:

    ::view-transition-group(.slide-in) {  }::view-transition-old(.slide-in) {}::view-transition-new(.slide-in) {}

In the future, CSS libraries may add built-in animations using View Transition Classes to make this easier to use.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   By default, `setState` updates immediately and does not activate `<ViewTransition>`, only updates wrapped in a [Transition](/reference/react/useTransition). You can also use [`<Suspense>`](/reference/react/Suspense) to opt-in to a Transition to [reveal content](/link-to-suspense-below).
*   `<ViewTransition>` creates an image that can be moved around, scaled and cross-faded. Unlike Layout Animations you may have seen in React Native or Motion, this means that not every individual Element inside of it animates its position. This can lead to better performance and a more continuous feeling, smooth animation compared to animating every individual piece. However, it can also lose continuity in things that should be moving by themselves. So you might have to add more `<ViewTransition>` boundaries manually as a result.
*   Many users may prefer not having animations on the page. React doesn’t automatically disable animations for this case. We recommend that using the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` media query to disable animations or tone them down based on user preference. In the future, CSS libraries may have this built-in to their presets.
*   Currently, `<ViewTransition>` only works in the DOM. We’re working on adding support for React Native and other platforms.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Animating an element on enter/exit[](#animating-an-element-on-enter "Link for Animating an element on enter/exit ")

Enter/Exit Transitions trigger when a `<ViewTransition>` is added or removed by a component in a transition:

    function Child() {  return <ViewTransition>Hi</ViewTransition>}function Parent() {  const [show, setShow] = useState();  if (show) {    return <Child />;  }  return null;}

When `setShow` is called, `show` switches to `true` and the `Child` component is rendered. When `setShow` is called inside `startTransition`, and `Child` renders a `ViewTransition` before any other DOM nodes, an `enter` animation is triggered.

When `show` switches back to `false`, an `exit` animation is triggered.

      \>{showItem ? '➖' : '➕'}</button\>

      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}
    </\>
  );
}

### Pitfall

`<ViewTransition>` only activates if it is placed before any DOM node. If `Child` instead looked like this, no animation would trigger:

    function Component() {  return (    <div>      <ViewTransition>Hi</ViewTransition>    </div>  );}

* * *

### Animating a shared element[](#animating-a-shared-element "Link for Animating a shared element ")

Normally, we don’t recommend assigning a name to a `<ViewTransition>` and instead let React assign it an automatic name. The reason you might want to assign a name is to animate between completely different components when one tree unmounts and another tree mounts at the same time. To preserve continuity.

    <ViewTransition name={UNIQUE_NAME}>  <Child /></ViewTransition>

When one tree unmounts and another mounts, if there’s a pair where the same name exists in the unmounting tree and the mounting tree, they trigger the “share” animation on both. It animates from the unmounting side to the mounting side.

Unlike an exit/enter animation this can be deeply inside the deleted/mounted tree. If a `<ViewTransition>` would also be eligible for exit/enter, then the “share” animation takes precedence.

If Transition first unmounts one side and then leads to a `<Suspense>` fallback being shown before eventually the new name being mounted, then no shared element transition happens.

      onExit\={() \=> startTransition(() \=> setFullscreen(false))}
    />
  }
  return <Video
    video\={videos\[0\]}
    onClick\={() \=> startTransition(() \=> setFullscreen(true))}
  />
}

Show more

### Note

If either the mounted or unmounted side of a pair is outside the viewport, then no pair is formed. This ensures that it doesn’t fly in or out of the viewport when something is scrolled. Instead it’s treated as a regular enter/exit by itself.

This does not happen if the same Component instance changes position, which triggers an “update”. Those animate regardless if one position is outside the viewport.

There’s currently a quirk where if a deeply nested unmounted `<ViewTransition>` is inside the viewport but the mounted side is not within the viewport, then the unmounted side animates as its own “exit” animation even if it’s deeply nested instead of as part of the parent animation.

### Pitfall

It’s important that there’s only one thing with the same name mounted at a time in the entire app. Therefore it’s important to use unique namespaces for the name to avoid conflicts. To ensure you can do this you might want to add a constant in a separate module that you import.

    export const MY_NAME = "my-globally-unique-name";import {MY_NAME} from './shared-name';...<ViewTransition name={MY_NAME}>

### Animating reorder of items in a list[](#animating-reorder-of-items-in-a-list "Link for Animating reorder of items in a list ")

    items.map(item => <Component key={item.id} item={item} />)

When reordering a list, without updating the content, the “update” animation triggers on each `<ViewTransition>` in the list if they’re outside a DOM node. Similar to enter/exit animations.

This means that this will trigger the animation on this `<ViewTransition>`:

    function Component() {  return <ViewTransition><div>...</div></ViewTransition>;}

However, this wouldn’t animate each individual item:

    function Component() {  return <div><ViewTransition>...</ViewTransition></div>;}

Instead, any parent `<ViewTransition>` would cross-fade. If there is no parent `<ViewTransition>` then there’s no animation in that case.

This means you might want to avoid wrapper elements in lists where you want to allow the Component to control its own reorder animation:

    items.map(item => <div><Component key={item.id} item={item} /></div>)

The above rule also applies if one of the items updates to resize, which then causes the siblings to resize, it’ll also animate its sibling `<ViewTransition>` but only if they’re immediate siblings.

This means that during an update, which causes a lot of re-layout, it doesn’t individually animate every `<ViewTransition>` on the page. That would lead to a lot of noisy animations which distracts from the actual change. Therefore React is more conservative about when an individual animation triggers.

### Pitfall

It’s important to properly use keys to preserve identity when reordering lists. It might seem like you could use “name”, shared element transitions, to animate reorders but that would not trigger if one side was outside the viewport. To animate a reorder you often want to show that it went to a position outside the viewport.

### Animating from Suspense content[](#animating-from-suspense-content "Link for Animating from Suspense content ")

Just like any Transition, React waits for data and new CSS (`<link rel="stylesheet" precedence="...">`) before running the animation. In addition to this, ViewTransitions also wait up to 500ms for new fonts to load before starting the animation to avoid them flickering in later. For the same reason, an image wrapped in ViewTransition will wait for the image to load.

If it’s inside a new Suspense boundary instance, then the fallback is shown first. After the Suspense boundary fully loads, it triggers the `<ViewTransition>` to animate the reveal to the content.

Currently, this only happens for client-side Transition. In the future, this will also animate Suspense boundary for streaming SSR when content from the server suspends during the initial load.

There are two ways to animate Suspense boundaries depending on where you place the `<ViewTransition>`:

Update:

    <ViewTransition>  <Suspense fallback={<A />}>    <B />  </Suspense></ViewTransition>

In this scenario when the content goes from A to B, it’ll be treated as an “update” and apply that class if appropriate. Both A and B will get the same view-transition-name and therefore they’re acting as a cross-fade by default.

Enter/Exit:

    <Suspense fallback={<ViewTransition><A /></ViewTransition>}>  <ViewTransition><B /></ViewTransition></Suspense>

In this scenario, these are two separate ViewTransition instances each with their own `view-transition-name`. This will be treated as an “exit” of the `<A>` and an “enter” of the `<B>`.

You can achieve different effects depending on where you choose to place the `<ViewTransition>` boundary.

### Opting-out of an animation[](#opting-out-of-an-animation "Link for Opting-out of an animation ")

Sometimes you’re wrapping a large existing component, like a whole page, and you want to animate some updates, such as changing the theme. However, you don’t want it to opt-in all updates inside the whole page to cross-fade when they’re updating. Especially if you’re incrementally adding more animations.

You can use the class “none” to opt-out of an animation. By wrapping your children in a “none” you can disable animations for updates to them while the parent still triggers.

    <ViewTransition>  <div className={theme}>    <ViewTransition update="none">      {children}    </ViewTransition>  </div></ViewTransition>

This will only animate if the theme changes and not if only the children update. The children can still opt-in again with their own `<ViewTransition>` but at least it’s manual again.

* * *

### Customizing animations[](#customizing-animations "Link for Customizing animations ")

By default, `<ViewTransition>` includes the default cross-fade from the browser.

To customize animations, you can provide props to the `<ViewTransition>` component to specify which animations to use, based on how the `<ViewTransition>` activates.

For example, we can slow down the default cross fade animation:

    <ViewTransition default="slow-fade">  <Video /></ViewTransition>

And define slow-fade in CSS using view transition classes:

    ::view-transition-old(.slow-fade) {    animation-duration: 500ms;}::view-transition-new(.slow-fade) {    animation-duration: 500ms;}

### Customizing animations with types[](#customizing-animations-with-types "Link for Customizing animations with types ")

You can use the [`addTransitionType`](/reference/react/addTransitionType) API to add a class name to the child elements when a specific transition type is activated for a specific activation trigger. This allows you to customize the animation for each type of transition.

For example, to customize the animation for all forward and backward navigations:

    <ViewTransition default={{  'navigation-back': 'slide-right',  'navigation-forward': 'slide-left', }}>  <div>...</div></ViewTransition> // in your router:startTransition(() => {  addTransitionType('navigation-' + navigationType);});

When the ViewTransition activates a “navigation-back” animation, React will add the class name “slide-right”. When the ViewTransition activates a “navigation-forward” animation, React will add the class name “slide-left”.

In the future, routers and other libraries may add support for standard view-transition types and styles.

### Building View Transition enabled routers[](#building-view-transition-enabled-routers "Link for Building View Transition enabled routers ")

React waits for any pending Navigation to finish to ensure that scroll restoration happens within the animation. If the Navigation is blocked on React, your router must unblock in `useLayoutEffect` since `useEffect` would lead to a deadlock.

If a `startTransition` is started from the legacy popstate event, such as during a “back”-navigation then it must finish synchronously to ensure scroll and form restoration works correctly. This is in conflict with running a View Transition animation. Therefore, React will skip animations from popstate. Therefore animations won’t run for the back button. You can fix this by upgrading your router to use the Navigation API.

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My `<ViewTransition>` is not activating[](#my-viewtransition-is-not-activating "Link for this heading")

`<ViewTransition>` only activates if it is placed is before any DOM node:

    function Component() {  return (    <div>      <ViewTransition>Hi</ViewTransition>    </div>  );}

To fix, ensure that the `<ViewTransition>` comes before any other DOM nodes:

    function Component() {  return (    <ViewTransition>      <div>Hi</div>    </ViewTransition>  );}

### I’m getting an error “There are two `<ViewTransition name=%s>` components with the same name mounted at the same time.”[](#two-viewtransition-with-same-name "Link for this heading")

This error occurs when two `<ViewTransition>` components with the same `name` are mounted at the same time:

    function Item() {  // 🚩 All items will get the same "name".  return <ViewTransition name="item">...</ViewTransition>;}function ItemList({items}) {  return (    <>      {item.map(item => <Item key={item.id} />)}    </>  );}

This will cause the View Transition to error. In development, React detects this issue to surface it and logs two errors:

Console

There are two `<ViewTransition name=%s>` components with the same name mounted at the same time. This is not supported and will cause View Transitions to error. Try to use a more unique name e.g. by using a namespace prefix and adding the id of an item to the name. at Item at ItemList

The existing `<ViewTransition name=%s>` duplicate has this stack trace. at Item at ItemList

To fix, ensure that there’s only one `<ViewTransition>` with the same name mounted at a time in the entire app by ensuring the `name` is unique, or adding an `id` to the name:

    function Item({id}) {  // ✅ All items will get the same "name".  return <ViewTransition name={`item-${id}`}>...</ViewTransition>;}function ItemList({items}) {  return (    <>      {item.map(item => <Item key={item.id} item={item} />)}    </>  );}

[API Reference](/reference/react)

Built-in React APIs[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
=========================================================

In addition to [Hooks](/reference/react) and [Components](/reference/react/components), the `react` package exports a few other APIs that are useful for defining components. This page lists all the remaining modern React APIs.

* * *

*   [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext) lets you define and provide context to the child components. Used with [`useContext`.](/reference/react/useContext)
*   [`forwardRef`](/reference/react/forwardRef) lets your component expose a DOM node as a ref to the parent. Used with [`useRef`.](/reference/react/useRef)
*   [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy) lets you defer loading a component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time.
*   [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) lets your component skip re-renders with same props. Used with [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) and [`useCallback`.](/reference/react/useCallback)
*   [`startTransition`](/reference/react/startTransition) lets you mark a state update as non-urgent. Similar to [`useTransition`.](/reference/react/useTransition)
*   [`act`](/reference/react/act) lets you wrap renders and interactions in tests to ensure updates have processed before making assertions.

* * *

Resource APIs[](#resource-apis "Link for Resource APIs ")
---------------------------------------------------------

_Resources_ can be accessed by a component without having them as part of their state. For example, a component can read a message from a Promise or read styling information from a context.

To read a value from a resource, use this API:

*   [`use`](/reference/react/use) lets you read the value of a resource like a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

    function MessageComponent({ messagePromise }) {  const message = use(messagePromise);  const theme = use(ThemeContext);  // ...}

act[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
=========================================

`act` is a test helper to apply pending React updates before making assertions.

    await act(async actFn)

To prepare a component for assertions, wrap the code rendering it and performing updates inside an `await act()` call. This makes your test run closer to how React works in the browser.

### Note

You might find using `act()` directly a bit too verbose. To avoid some of the boilerplate, you could use a library like [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), whose helpers are wrapped with `act()`.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `await act(async actFn)`[](#await-act-async-actfn "Link for this heading")

When writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. React provides a helper called `act()` that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions.

The name `act` comes from the [Arrange-Act-Assert](https://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert) pattern.

    it ('renders with button disabled', async () => {  await act(async () => {    root.render(<TestComponent />)  });  expect(container.querySelector('button')).toBeDisabled();});

### Note

We recommend using `act` with `await` and an `async` function. Although the sync version works in many cases, it doesn’t work in all cases and due to the way React schedules updates internally, it’s difficult to predict when you can use the sync version.

We will deprecate and remove the sync version in the future.

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `async actFn`: An async function wrapping renders or interactions for components being tested. Any updates triggered within the `actFn`, are added to an internal act queue, which are then flushed together to process and apply any changes to the DOM. Since it is async, React will also run any code that crosses an async boundary, and flush any updates scheduled.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`act` does not return anything.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

When testing a component, you can use `act` to make assertions about its output.

For example, let’s say we have this `Counter` component, the usage examples below show how to test it:

    function Counter() {  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  const handleClick = () => {    setCount(prev => prev + 1);  }  useEffect(() => {    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;  }, [count]);  return (    <div>      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>      <button onClick={handleClick}>        Click me      </button>    </div>  )}

### Rendering components in tests[](#rendering-components-in-tests "Link for Rendering components in tests ")

To test the render output of a component, wrap the render inside `act()`:

    import {act} from 'react';import ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';import Counter from './Counter';it('can render and update a counter', async () => {  container = document.createElement('div');  document.body.appendChild(container);    // ✅ Render the component inside act().  await act(() => {    ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />);  });    const button = container.querySelector('button');  const label = container.querySelector('p');  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 0 times');  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 0 times');});

Here, we create a container, append it to the document, and render the `Counter` component inside `act()`. This ensures that the component is rendered and its effects are applied before making assertions.

Using `act` ensures that all updates have been applied before we make assertions.

### Dispatching events in tests[](#dispatching-events-in-tests "Link for Dispatching events in tests ")

To test events, wrap the event dispatch inside `act()`:

    import {act} from 'react';import ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';import Counter from './Counter';it.only('can render and update a counter', async () => {  const container = document.createElement('div');  document.body.appendChild(container);    await act( async () => {    ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />);  });    // ✅ Dispatch the event inside act().  await act(async () => {    button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', { bubbles: true }));  });  const button = container.querySelector('button');  const label = container.querySelector('p');  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 1 times');  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 1 times');});

Here, we render the component with `act`, and then dispatch the event inside another `act()`. This ensures that all updates from the event are applied before making assertions.

### Pitfall

Don’t forget that dispatching DOM events only works when the DOM container is added to the document. You can use a library like [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) to reduce the boilerplate code.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### I’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)”[](#error-the-current-testing-environment-is-not-configured-to-support-act "Link for I’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)” ")

Using `act` requires setting `global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true` in your test environment. This is to ensure that `act` is only used in the correct environment.

If you don’t set the global, you will see an error like this:

Console

Warning: The current testing environment is not configured to support act(…)

To fix, add this to your global setup file for React tests:

    global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true

### Note

In testing frameworks like [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro), `IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT` is already set for you.

### React Server Components

`cache` is only for use with [React Server Components](/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components).

`cache` lets you cache the result of a data fetch or computation.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `cache(fn)`[](#cache "Link for this heading")

Call `cache` outside of any components to create a version of the function with caching.

    import {cache} from 'react';import calculateMetrics from 'lib/metrics';const getMetrics = cache(calculateMetrics);function Chart({data}) {  const report = getMetrics(data);  // ...}

When `getMetrics` is first called with `data`, `getMetrics` will call `calculateMetrics(data)` and store the result in cache. If `getMetrics` is called again with the same `data`, it will return the cached result instead of calling `calculateMetrics(data)` again.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `fn`: The function you want to cache results for. `fn` can take any arguments and return any value.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`cache` returns a cached version of `fn` with the same type signature. It does not call `fn` in the process.

When calling `cachedFn` with given arguments, it first checks if a cached result exists in the cache. If a cached result exists, it returns the result. If not, it calls `fn` with the arguments, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result. The only time `fn` is called is when there is a cache miss.

### Note

The optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as [_memoization_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization). We refer to the function returned from `cache` as a memoized function.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   React will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request.
*   Each call to `cache` creates a new function. This means that calling `cache` with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache.
*   `cachedFn` will also cache errors. If `fn` throws an error for certain arguments, it will be cached, and the same error is re-thrown when `cachedFn` is called with those same arguments.
*   `cache` is for use in [Server Components](/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components) only.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Cache an expensive computation[](#cache-expensive-computation "Link for Cache an expensive computation ")

Use `cache` to skip duplicate work.

    import {cache} from 'react';import calculateUserMetrics from 'lib/user';const getUserMetrics = cache(calculateUserMetrics);function Profile({user}) {  const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);  // ...}function TeamReport({users}) {  for (let user in users) {    const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);    // ...  }  // ...}

If the same `user` object is rendered in both `Profile` and `TeamReport`, the two components can share work and only call `calculateUserMetrics` once for that `user`.

Assume `Profile` is rendered first. It will call `getUserMetrics`, and check if there is a cached result. Since it is the first time `getUserMetrics` is called with that `user`, there will be a cache miss. `getUserMetrics` will then call `calculateUserMetrics` with that `user` and write the result to cache.

When `TeamReport` renders its list of `users` and reaches the same `user` object, it will call `getUserMetrics` and read the result from cache.

### Pitfall

##### Calling different memoized functions will read from different caches.[](#pitfall-different-memoized-functions "Link for Calling different memoized functions will read from different caches. ")

To access the same cache, components must call the same memoized function.

    // Temperature.jsimport {cache} from 'react';import {calculateWeekReport} from './report';export function Temperature({cityData}) {  // 🚩 Wrong: Calling `cache` in component creates new `getWeekReport` for each render  const getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);  // ...}

    // Precipitation.jsimport {cache} from 'react';import {calculateWeekReport} from './report';// 🚩 Wrong: `getWeekReport` is only accessible for `Precipitation` component.const getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);export function Precipitation({cityData}) {  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);  // ...}

In the above example, `Precipitation` and `Temperature` each call `cache` to create a new memoized function with their own cache look-up. If both components render for the same `cityData`, they will do duplicate work to call `calculateWeekReport`.

In addition, `Temperature` creates a new memoized function each time the component is rendered which doesn’t allow for any cache sharing.

To maximize cache hits and reduce work, the two components should call the same memoized function to access the same cache. Instead, define the memoized function in a dedicated module that can be [`import`\-ed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) across components.

    // getWeekReport.jsimport {cache} from 'react';import {calculateWeekReport} from './report';export default cache(calculateWeekReport);

    // Temperature.jsimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';export default function Temperature({cityData}) {	const report = getWeekReport(cityData);  // ...}

    // Precipitation.jsimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';export default function Precipitation({cityData}) {  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);  // ...}

Here, both components call the same memoized function exported from `./getWeekReport.js` to read and write to the same cache.

### Share a snapshot of data[](#take-and-share-snapshot-of-data "Link for Share a snapshot of data ")

To share a snapshot of data between components, call `cache` with a data-fetching function like `fetch`. When multiple components make the same data fetch, only one request is made and the data returned is cached and shared across components. All components refer to the same snapshot of data across the server render.

    import {cache} from 'react';import {fetchTemperature} from './api.js';const getTemperature = cache(async (city) => {	return await fetchTemperature(city);});async function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {	const temperature = await getTemperature(city);	// ...}async function MinimalWeatherCard({city}) {	const temperature = await getTemperature(city);	// ...}

If `AnimatedWeatherCard` and `MinimalWeatherCard` both render for the same city, they will receive the same snapshot of data from the memoized function.

If `AnimatedWeatherCard` and `MinimalWeatherCard` supply different city arguments to `getTemperature`, then `fetchTemperature` will be called twice and each call site will receive different data.

The city acts as a cache key.

### Note

Asynchronous rendering is only supported for Server Components.

    async function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {	const temperature = await getTemperature(city);	// ...}

### Preload data[](#preload-data "Link for Preload data ")

By caching a long-running data fetch, you can kick off asynchronous work prior to rendering the component.

    const getUser = cache(async (id) => {  return await db.user.query(id);});async function Profile({id}) {  const user = await getUser(id);  return (    <section>      <img src={user.profilePic} />      <h2>{user.name}</h2>    </section>  );}function Page({id}) {  // ✅ Good: start fetching the user data  getUser(id);  // ... some computational work  return (    <>      <Profile id={id} />    </>  );}

When rendering `Page`, the component calls `getUser` but note that it doesn’t use the returned data. This early `getUser` call kicks off the asynchronous database query that occurs while `Page` is doing other computational work and rendering children.

When rendering `Profile`, we call `getUser` again. If the initial `getUser` call has already returned and cached the user data, when `Profile` asks and waits for this data, it can simply read from the cache without requiring another remote procedure call. If the initial data request hasn’t been completed, preloading data in this pattern reduces delay in data-fetching.

##### Deep Dive

#### Caching asynchronous work[](#caching-asynchronous-work "Link for Caching asynchronous work ")

Show Details

When evaluating an [asynchronous function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), you will receive a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for that work. The promise holds the state of that work (_pending_, _fulfilled_, _failed_) and its eventual settled result.

In this example, the asynchronous function `fetchData` returns a promise that is awaiting the `fetch`.

    async function fetchData() {  return await fetch(`https://...`);}const getData = cache(fetchData);async function MyComponent() {  getData();  // ... some computational work    await getData();  // ...}

In calling `getData` the first time, the promise returned from `fetchData` is cached. Subsequent look-ups will then return the same promise.

Notice that the first `getData` call does not `await` whereas the second does. [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) is a JavaScript operator that will wait and return the settled result of the promise. The first `getData` call simply initiates the `fetch` to cache the promise for the second `getData` to look-up.

If by the second call the promise is still _pending_, then `await` will pause for the result. The optimization is that while we wait on the `fetch`, React can continue with computational work, thus reducing the wait time for the second call.

If the promise is already settled, either to an error or the _fulfilled_ result, `await` will return that value immediately. In both outcomes, there is a performance benefit.

### Pitfall

##### Calling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache.[](#pitfall-memoized-call-outside-component "Link for Calling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache. ")

    import {cache} from 'react';const getUser = cache(async (userId) => {  return await db.user.query(userId);});// 🚩 Wrong: Calling memoized function outside of component will not memoize.getUser('demo-id');async function DemoProfile() {  // ✅ Good: `getUser` will memoize.  const user = await getUser('demo-id');  return <Profile user={user} />;}

React only provides cache access to the memoized function in a component. When calling `getUser` outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache.

This is because cache access is provided through a [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) which is only accessible from a component.

##### Deep Dive

#### When should I use `cache`, [`memo`](/reference/react/memo), or [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo)?[](#cache-memo-usememo "Link for this heading")

Show Details

All mentioned APIs offer memoization but the difference is what they’re intended to memoize, who can access the cache, and when their cache is invalidated.

#### `useMemo`[](#deep-dive-use-memo "Link for this heading")

In general, you should use [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) for caching a expensive computation in a Client Component across renders. As an example, to memoize a transformation of data within a component.

    'use client';function WeatherReport({record}) {  const avgTemp = useMemo(() => calculateAvg(record), record);  // ...}function App() {  const record = getRecord();  return (    <>      <WeatherReport record={record} />      <WeatherReport record={record} />    </>  );}

In this example, `App` renders two `WeatherReport`s with the same record. Even though both components do the same work, they cannot share work. `useMemo`’s cache is only local to the component.

However, `useMemo` does ensure that if `App` re-renders and the `record` object doesn’t change, each component instance would skip work and use the memoized value of `avgTemp`. `useMemo` will only cache the last computation of `avgTemp` with the given dependencies.

#### `cache`[](#deep-dive-cache "Link for this heading")

In general, you should use `cache` in Server Components to memoize work that can be shared across components.

    const cachedFetchReport = cache(fetchReport);function WeatherReport({city}) {  const report = cachedFetchReport(city);  // ...}function App() {  const city = "Los Angeles";  return (    <>      <WeatherReport city={city} />      <WeatherReport city={city} />    </>  );}

Re-writing the previous example to use `cache`, in this case the second instance of `WeatherReport` will be able to skip duplicate work and read from the same cache as the first `WeatherReport`. Another difference from the previous example is that `cache` is also recommended for memoizing data fetches, unlike `useMemo` which should only be used for computations.

At this time, `cache` should only be used in Server Components and the cache will be invalidated across server requests.

#### `memo`[](#deep-dive-memo "Link for this heading")

You should use [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) to prevent a component re-rendering if its props are unchanged.

    'use client';function WeatherReport({record}) {  const avgTemp = calculateAvg(record);   // ...}const MemoWeatherReport = memo(WeatherReport);function App() {  const record = getRecord();  return (    <>      <MemoWeatherReport record={record} />      <MemoWeatherReport record={record} />    </>  );}

In this example, both `MemoWeatherReport` components will call `calculateAvg` when first rendered. However, if `App` re-renders, with no changes to `record`, none of the props have changed and `MemoWeatherReport` will not re-render.

Compared to `useMemo`, `memo` memoizes the component render based on props vs. specific computations. Similar to `useMemo`, the memoized component only caches the last render with the last prop values. Once the props change, the cache invalidates and the component re-renders.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments[](#memoized-function-still-runs "Link for My memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments ")

See prior mentioned pitfalls

*   [Calling different memoized functions will read from different caches.](#pitfall-different-memoized-functions)
*   [Calling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache.](#pitfall-memoized-call-outside-component)

If none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache.

If your arguments are not [primitives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) (ex. objects, functions, arrays), ensure you’re passing the same object reference.

When calling a memoized function, React will look up the input arguments to see if a result is already cached. React will use shallow equality of the arguments to determine if there is a cache hit.

    import {cache} from 'react';const calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {  // ...});function MapMarker(props) {  // 🚩 Wrong: props is an object that changes every render.  const length = calculateNorm(props);  // ...}function App() {  return (    <>      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />    </>  );}

In this case the two `MapMarker`s look like they’re doing the same work and calling `calculateNorm` with the same value of `{x: 10, y: 10, z:10}`. Even though the objects contain the same values, they are not the same object reference as each component creates its own `props` object.

React will call [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) on the input to verify if there is a cache hit.

    import {cache} from 'react';const calculateNorm = cache((x, y, z) => {  // ...});function MapMarker(props) {  // ✅ Good: Pass primitives to memoized function  const length = calculateNorm(props.x, props.y, props.z);  // ...}function App() {  return (    <>      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />    </>  );}

One way to address this could be to pass the vector dimensions to `calculateNorm`. This works because the dimensions themselves are primitives.

Another solution may be to pass the vector object itself as a prop to the component. We’ll need to pass the same object to both component instances.

    import {cache} from 'react';const calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {  // ...});function MapMarker(props) {  // ✅ Good: Pass the same `vector` object  const length = calculateNorm(props.vector);  // ...}function App() {  const vector = [10, 10, 10];  return (    <>      <MapMarker vector={vector} />      <MapMarker vector={vector} />    </>  );}

### `captureOwnerStack()`[](#captureownerstack "Link for this heading")

Call `captureOwnerStack` to get the current Owner Stack.

    import * as React from 'react';function Component() {  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {    const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();    console.log(ownerStack);  }}

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`captureOwnerStack` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`captureOwnerStack` returns `string | null`.

Owner Stacks are available in

*   Component render
*   Effects (e.g. `useEffect`)
*   React’s event handlers (e.g. `<button onClick={...} />`)
*   React error handlers ([React Root options](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#parameters) `onCaughtError`, `onRecoverableError`, and `onUncaughtError`)

If no Owner Stack is available, `null` is returned (see [Troubleshooting: The Owner Stack is `null`](#the-owner-stack-is-null)).

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Owner Stacks are only available in development. `captureOwnerStack` will always return `null` outside of development.

##### Deep Dive

#### Owner Stack vs Component Stack[](#owner-stack-vs-component-stack "Link for Owner Stack vs Component Stack ")

Show Details

The Owner Stack is different from the Component Stack available in React error handlers like [`errorInfo.componentStack` in `onUncaughtError`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#show-a-dialog-for-uncaught-errors).

For example, consider the following code:

index.jsApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import {captureOwnerStack} from 'react';

import App, {Component} from './App.js';
import './styles.css';

createRoot(document.createElement('div'), {
  onUncaughtError: (error, errorInfo) \=> {
    // The stacks are logged instead of showing them in the UI directly to
    // highlight that browsers will apply sourcemaps to the logged stacks.
    // Note that sourcemapping is only applied in the real browser console not
    // in the fake one displayed on this page.
    // Press "fork" to be able to view the sourcemapped stack in a real console.
    console.log(errorInfo.componentStack);
    console.log(captureOwnerStack());
  },
}).render(
  <App\>
    <Component label\="disabled" />
  </App\>
);

`SubComponent` would throw an error. The Component Stack of that error would be

    at SubComponentat fieldsetat Componentat mainat React.Suspenseat App

However, the Owner Stack would only read

    at Component

Neither `App` nor the DOM components (e.g. `fieldset`) are considered Owners in this Stack since they didn’t contribute to “creating” the node containing `SubComponent`. `App` and DOM components only forwarded the node. `App` just rendered the `children` node as opposed to `Component` which created a node containing `SubComponent` via `<SubComponent />`.

Neither `Navigation` nor `legend` are in the stack at all since it’s only a sibling to a node containing `<SubComponent />`.

`SubComponent` is omitted because it’s already part of the callstack.

During render, Effects, React event handlers, and React error handlers (e.g. `hydrateRoot#options.onCaughtError`) Owner Stacks should be available.

In the example below, clicking the button will log an empty Owner Stack because `captureOwnerStack` was called during a custom DOM event handler. The Owner Stack must be captured earlier e.g. by moving the call of `captureOwnerStack` into the Effect body.

createContext[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===================================================

`createContext` lets you create a [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) that components can provide or read.

    const SomeContext = createContext(defaultValue)

*   [Reference](#reference)
    *   [`createContext(defaultValue)`](#createcontext)

    *   [I can’t find a way to change the context value](#i-cant-find-a-way-to-change-the-context-value)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `createContext(defaultValue)`[](#createcontext "Link for this heading")

Call `createContext` outside of any components to create a context.

    import { createContext } from 'react';const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `defaultValue`: The value that you want the context to have when there is no matching context provider in the tree above the component that reads context. If you don’t have any meaningful default value, specify `null`. The default value is meant as a “last resort” fallback. It is static and never changes over time.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`createContext` returns a context object.

**The context object itself does not hold any information.** It represents _which_ context other components read or provide. Typically, you will use [`SomeContext.Provider`](#provider) in components above to specify the context value, and call [`useContext(SomeContext)`](/reference/react/useContext) in components below to read it. The context object has a few properties:

*   `SomeContext.Provider` lets you provide the context value to components.
*   `SomeContext.Consumer` is an alternative and rarely used way to read the context value.

* * *

### `SomeContext.Provider`[](#provider "Link for this heading")

Wrap your components into a context provider to specify the value of this context for all components inside:

    function App() {  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');  // ...  return (    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>      <Page />    </ThemeContext.Provider>  );}

#### Props[](#provider-props "Link for Props ")

*   `value`: The value that you want to pass to all the components reading this context inside this provider, no matter how deep. The context value can be of any type. A component calling [`useContext(SomeContext)`](/reference/react/useContext) inside of the provider receives the `value` of the innermost corresponding context provider above it.

* * *

### `SomeContext.Consumer`[](#consumer "Link for this heading")

Before `useContext` existed, there was an older way to read context:

    function Button() {  // 🟡 Legacy way (not recommended)  return (    <ThemeContext.Consumer>      {theme => (        <button className={theme} />      )}    </ThemeContext.Consumer>  );}

Although this older way still works, **newly written code should read context with [`useContext()`](/reference/react/useContext) instead:**

    function Button() {  // ✅ Recommended way  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  return <button className={theme} />;}

#### Props[](#consumer-props "Link for Props ")

*   `children`: A function. React will call the function you pass with the current context value determined by the same algorithm as [`useContext()`](/reference/react/useContext) does, and render the result you return from this function. React will also re-run this function and update the UI whenever the context from the parent components changes.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Creating context[](#creating-context "Link for Creating context ")

Context lets components [pass information deep down](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) without explicitly passing props.

Call `createContext` outside any components to create one or more contexts.

    import { createContext } from 'react';const ThemeContext = createContext('light');const AuthContext = createContext(null);

`createContext` returns a context object. Components can read context by passing it to [`useContext()`](/reference/react/useContext):

    function Button() {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  // ...}function Profile() {  const currentUser = useContext(AuthContext);  // ...}

By default, the values they receive will be the default values you have specified when creating the contexts. However, by itself this isn’t useful because the default values never change.

Context is useful because you can **provide other, dynamic values from your components:**

    function App() {  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({ name: 'Taylor' });  // ...  return (    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>      <AuthContext.Provider value={currentUser}>        <Page />      </AuthContext.Provider>    </ThemeContext.Provider>  );}

Now the `Page` component and any components inside it, no matter how deep, will “see” the passed context values. If the passed context values change, React will re-render the components reading the context as well.

[Read more about reading and providing context and see examples.](/reference/react/useContext)

* * *

### Importing and exporting context from a file[](#importing-and-exporting-context-from-a-file "Link for Importing and exporting context from a file ")

Often, components in different files will need access to the same context. This is why it’s common to declare contexts in a separate file. Then you can use the [`export` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) to make context available for other files:

    // Contexts.jsimport { createContext } from 'react';export const ThemeContext = createContext('light');export const AuthContext = createContext(null);

Components declared in other files can then use the [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import) statement to read or provide this context:

    // Button.jsimport { ThemeContext } from './Contexts.js';function Button() {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  // ...}

    // App.jsimport { ThemeContext, AuthContext } from './Contexts.js';function App() {  // ...  return (    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>      <AuthContext.Provider value={currentUser}>        <Page />      </AuthContext.Provider>    </ThemeContext.Provider>  );}

This works similar to [importing and exporting components.](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### I can’t find a way to change the context value[](#i-cant-find-a-way-to-change-the-context-value "Link for I can’t find a way to change the context value ")

Code like this specifies the _default_ context value:

lazy[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==========================================

`lazy` lets you defer loading component’s code until it is rendered for the first time.

    const SomeComponent = lazy(load)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `lazy(load)`[](#lazy "Link for this heading")

Call `lazy` outside your components to declare a lazy-loaded React component:

    import { lazy } from 'react';const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `load`: A function that returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or another _thenable_ (a Promise-like object with a `then` method). React will not call `load` until the first time you attempt to render the returned component. After React first calls `load`, it will wait for it to resolve, and then render the resolved value’s `.default` as a React component. Both the returned Promise and the Promise’s resolved value will be cached, so React will not call `load` more than once. If the Promise rejects, React will `throw` the rejection reason for the nearest Error Boundary to handle.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`lazy` returns a React component you can render in your tree. While the code for the lazy component is still loading, attempting to render it will _suspend._ Use [`<Suspense>`](/reference/react/Suspense) to display a loading indicator while it’s loading.

* * *

### `load` function[](#load "Link for this heading")

#### Parameters[](#load-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`load` receives no parameters.

#### Returns[](#load-returns "Link for Returns ")

You need to return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or some other _thenable_ (a Promise-like object with a `then` method). It needs to eventually resolve to an object whose `.default` property is a valid React component type, such as a function, [`memo`](/reference/react/memo), or a [`forwardRef`](/reference/react/forwardRef) component.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Lazy-loading components with Suspense[](#suspense-for-code-splitting "Link for Lazy-loading components with Suspense ")

Usually, you import components with the static [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) declaration:

    import MarkdownPreview from './MarkdownPreview.js';

To defer loading this component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time, replace this import with:

    import { lazy } from 'react';const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));

This code relies on [dynamic `import()`,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) which might require support from your bundler or framework. Using this pattern requires that the lazy component you’re importing was exported as the `default` export.

Now that your component’s code loads on demand, you also need to specify what should be displayed while it is loading. You can do this by wrapping the lazy component or any of its parents into a [`<Suspense>`](/reference/react/Suspense) boundary:

    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>  <h2>Preview</h2>  <MarkdownPreview /></Suspense>

In this example, the code for `MarkdownPreview` won’t be loaded until you attempt to render it. If `MarkdownPreview` hasn’t loaded yet, `Loading` will be shown in its place. Try ticking the checkbox:

App.jsLoading.jsMarkdownPreview.js

App.js

const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() \=> delayForDemo(import('./MarkdownPreview.js')));

export default function MarkdownEditor() {
  const \[showPreview, setShowPreview\] = useState(false);
  const \[markdown, setMarkdown\] = useState('Hello, \*\*world\*\*!');
  return (
    <\>
      <textarea value\={markdown} onChange\={e \=> setMarkdown(e.target.value)} />
      <label\>
        <input type\="checkbox" checked\={showPreview} onChange\={e \=> setShowPreview(e.target.checked)} />
        Show preview
      </label\>
      <hr />
      {showPreview && (
        <Suspense fallback\={<Loading />}\>
          <h2\>Preview</h2\>
          <MarkdownPreview markdown\={markdown} />
        </Suspense\>
      )}
    </\>
  );
}

// Add a fixed delay so you can see the loading state
function delayForDemo(promise) {
  return new Promise(resolve \=> {
    setTimeout(resolve, 2000);
  }).then(() \=> promise);
}

This demo loads with an artificial delay. The next time you untick and tick the checkbox, `Preview` will be cached, so there will be no loading state. To see the loading state again, click “Reset” on the sandbox.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My `lazy` component’s state gets reset unexpectedly[](#my-lazy-components-state-gets-reset-unexpectedly "Link for this heading")

Do not declare `lazy` components _inside_ other components:

    import { lazy } from 'react';function Editor() {  // 🔴 Bad: This will cause all state to be reset on re-renders  const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));  // ...}

Instead, always declare them at the top level of your module:

    import { lazy } from 'react';// ✅ Good: Declare lazy components outside of your componentsconst MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));function Editor() {  // ...}

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `memo(Component, arePropsEqual?)`[](#memo "Link for this heading")

Wrap a component in `memo` to get a _memoized_ version of that component. This memoized version of your component will usually not be re-rendered when its parent component is re-rendered as long as its props have not changed. But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee.

    import { memo } from 'react';const SomeComponent = memo(function SomeComponent(props) {  // ...});

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `Component`: The component that you want to memoize. The `memo` does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead. Any valid React component, including functions and [`forwardRef`](/reference/react/forwardRef) components, is accepted.
    
*   **optional** `arePropsEqual`: A function that accepts two arguments: the component’s previous props, and its new props. It should return `true` if the old and new props are equal: that is, if the component will render the same output and behave in the same way with the new props as with the old. Otherwise it should return `false`. Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with [`Object.is`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`memo` returns a new React component. It behaves the same as the component provided to `memo` except that React will not always re-render it when its parent is being re-rendered unless its props have changed.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Skipping re-rendering when props are unchanged[](#skipping-re-rendering-when-props-are-unchanged "Link for Skipping re-rendering when props are unchanged ")

React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. With `memo`, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props are the same as the old props. Such a component is said to be _memoized_.

To memoize a component, wrap it in `memo` and use the value that it returns in place of your original component:

    const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;});export default Greeting;

A React component should always have [pure rendering logic.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using `memo`, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props haven’t changed. Even with `memo`, your component will re-render if its own state changes or if a context that it’s using changes.

In this example, notice that the `Greeting` component re-renders whenever `name` is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when `address` is changed (because it’s not passed to `Greeting` as a prop):

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { memo, useState } from 'react';

export default function MyApp() {
  const \[name, setName\] = useState('');
  const \[address, setAddress\] = useState('');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Name{': '}
        <input value\={name} onChange\={e \=> setName(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <label\>
        Address{': '}
        <input value\={address} onChange\={e \=> setAddress(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Greeting name\={name} />
    </\>
  );
}

const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {
  console.log("Greeting was rendered at", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  return <h3\>Hello{name && ', '}{name}!</h3\>;
});

### Note

**You should only rely on `memo` as a performance optimization.** If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add `memo` to improve performance.

##### Deep Dive

#### Should you add memo everywhere?[](#should-you-add-memo-everywhere "Link for Should you add memo everywhere? ")

Show Details

If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.

Optimizing with `memo` is only valuable when your component re-renders often with the same exact props, and its re-rendering logic is expensive. If there is no perceptible lag when your component re-renders, `memo` is unnecessary. Keep in mind that `memo` is completely useless if the props passed to your component are _always different,_ such as if you pass an object or a plain function defined during rendering. This is why you will often need [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo#skipping-re-rendering-of-components) and [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback#skipping-re-rendering-of-components) together with `memo`.

There is no benefit to wrapping a component in `memo` in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component.

**In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:**

1.  When a component visually wraps other components, let it [accept JSX as children.](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) This way, when the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don’t need to re-render.
2.  Prefer local state and don’t [lift state up](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) any further than necessary. For example, don’t keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library.
3.  Keep your [rendering logic pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it’s a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization.
4.  Avoid [unnecessary Effects that update state.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.
5.  Try to [remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) For example, instead of memoization, it’s often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component.

If a specific interaction still feels laggy, [use the React Developer Tools profiler](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we’re researching [doing granular memoization automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc) to solve this once and for all.

### Updating a memoized component using state[](#updating-a-memoized-component-using-state "Link for Updating a memoized component using state ")

Even when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when its own state changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { memo, useState } from 'react';

export default function MyApp() {
  const \[name, setName\] = useState('');
  const \[address, setAddress\] = useState('');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Name{': '}
        <input value\={name} onChange\={e \=> setName(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <label\>
        Address{': '}
        <input value\={address} onChange\={e \=> setAddress(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Greeting name\={name} />
    </\>
  );
}

const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {
  console.log('Greeting was rendered at', new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  const \[greeting, setGreeting\] = useState('Hello');
  return (
    <\>
      <h3\>{greeting}{name && ', '}{name}!</h3\>
      <GreetingSelector value\={greeting} onChange\={setGreeting} />
    </\>
  );
});

function GreetingSelector({ value, onChange }) {
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        <input
          type\="radio"
          checked\={value === 'Hello'}
          onChange\={e \=> onChange('Hello')}
        />
        Regular greeting
      </label\>
      <label\>
        <input
          type\="radio"
          checked\={value === 'Hello and welcome'}
          onChange\={e \=> onChange('Hello and welcome')}
        />
        Enthusiastic greeting
      </label\>
    </\>
  );
}

If you set a state variable to its current value, React will skip re-rendering your component even without `memo`. You may still see your component function being called an extra time, but the result will be discarded.

* * *

### Updating a memoized component using a context[](#updating-a-memoized-component-using-a-context "Link for Updating a memoized component using a context ")

Even when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it’s using changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createContext, memo, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext(null);

export default function MyApp() {
  const \[theme, setTheme\] = useState('dark');

  function handleClick() {
    setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'); 
  }

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value\={theme}\>
      <button onClick\={handleClick}\>
        Switch theme
      </button\>
      <Greeting name\="Taylor" />
    </ThemeContext.Provider\>
  );
}

const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {
  console.log("Greeting was rendered at", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <h3 className\={theme}\>Hello, {name}!</h3\>
  );
});

To make your component re-render only when a _part_ of some context changes, split your component in two. Read what you need from the context in the outer component, and pass it down to a memoized child as a prop.

* * *

### Minimizing props changes[](#minimizing-props-changes "Link for Minimizing props changes ")

When you use `memo`, your component re-renders whenever any prop is not _shallowly equal_ to what it was previously. This means that React compares every prop in your component with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. Note that `Object.is(3, 3)` is `true`, but `Object.is({}, {})` is `false`.

To get the most out of `memo`, minimize the times that the props change. For example, if the prop is an object, prevent the parent component from re-creating that object every time by using [`useMemo`:](/reference/react/useMemo)

    function Page() {  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);  const person = useMemo(    () => ({ name, age }),    [name, age]  );  return <Profile person={person} />;}const Profile = memo(function Profile({ person }) {  // ...});

A better way to minimize props changes is to make sure the component accepts the minimum necessary information in its props. For example, it could accept individual values instead of a whole object:

    function Page() {  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);  return <Profile name={name} age={age} />;}const Profile = memo(function Profile({ name, age }) {  // ...});

Even individual values can sometimes be projected to ones that change less frequently. For example, here a component accepts a boolean indicating the presence of a value rather than the value itself:

    function GroupsLanding({ person }) {  const hasGroups = person.groups !== null;  return <CallToAction hasGroups={hasGroups} />;}const CallToAction = memo(function CallToAction({ hasGroups }) {  // ...});

When you need to pass a function to memoized component, either declare it outside your component so that it never changes, or [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback#skipping-re-rendering-of-components) to cache its definition between re-renders.

* * *

### Specifying a custom comparison function[](#specifying-a-custom-comparison-function "Link for Specifying a custom comparison function ")

In rare cases it may be infeasible to minimize the props changes of a memoized component. In that case, you can provide a custom comparison function, which React will use to compare the old and new props instead of using shallow equality. This function is passed as a second argument to `memo`. It should return `true` only if the new props would result in the same output as the old props; otherwise it should return `false`.

    const Chart = memo(function Chart({ dataPoints }) {  // ...}, arePropsEqual);function arePropsEqual(oldProps, newProps) {  return (    oldProps.dataPoints.length === newProps.dataPoints.length &&    oldProps.dataPoints.every((oldPoint, index) => {      const newPoint = newProps.dataPoints[index];      return oldPoint.x === newPoint.x && oldPoint.y === newPoint.y;    })  );}

If you do this, use the Performance panel in your browser developer tools to make sure that your comparison function is actually faster than re-rendering the component. You might be surprised.

When you do performance measurements, make sure that React is running in the production mode.

### Pitfall

If you provide a custom `arePropsEqual` implementation, **you must compare every prop, including functions.** Functions often [close over](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) the props and state of parent components. If you return `true` when `oldProps.onClick !== newProps.onClick`, your component will keep “seeing” the props and state from a previous render inside its `onClick` handler, leading to very confusing bugs.

Avoid doing deep equality checks inside `arePropsEqual` unless you are 100% sure that the data structure you’re working with has a known limited depth. **Deep equality checks can become incredibly slow** and can freeze your app for many seconds if someone changes the data structure later.

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My component re-renders when a prop is an object, array, or function[](#my-component-rerenders-when-a-prop-is-an-object-or-array "Link for My component re-renders when a prop is an object, array, or function ")

React compares old and new props by shallow equality: that is, it considers whether each new prop is reference-equal to the old prop. If you create a new object or array each time the parent is re-rendered, even if the individual elements are each the same, React will still consider it to be changed. Similarly, if you create a new function when rendering the parent component, React will consider it to have changed even if the function has the same definition. To avoid this, [simplify props or memoize props in the parent component](#minimizing-props-changes).

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `startTransition(action)`[](#starttransition "Link for this heading")

The `startTransition` function lets you mark a state update as a Transition.

    import { startTransition } from 'react';function TabContainer() {  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');  function selectTab(nextTab) {    startTransition(() => {      setTab(nextTab);    });  }  // ...}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `action`: A function that updates some state by calling one or more [`set` functions](/reference/react/useState#setstate). React calls `action` immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the `action` function call as Transitions. Any async calls awaited in the `action` will be included in the transition, but currently require wrapping any `set` functions after the `await` in an additional `startTransition` (see [Troubleshooting](/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)). State updates marked as Transitions will be [non-blocking](#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) and [will not display unwanted loading indicators.](/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators).

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`startTransition` does not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `startTransition` does not provide a way to track whether a Transition is pending. To show a pending indicator while the Transition is ongoing, you need [`useTransition`](/reference/react/useTransition) instead.
    
*   You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the `set` function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook return value, try [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue) instead.
    
*   The function you pass to `startTransition` is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a `setTimeout`, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.
    
*   You must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another `startTransition` to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see [Troubleshooting](/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)).
    
*   A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input state update.
    
*   Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.
    
*   If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.
    

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition[](#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition "Link for Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition ")

You can mark a state update as a _Transition_ by wrapping it in a `startTransition` call:

    import { startTransition } from 'react';function TabContainer() {  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');  function selectTab(nextTab) {    startTransition(() => {      setTab(nextTab);    });  }  // ...}

Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.

With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.

### Note

`startTransition` is very similar to [`useTransition`](/reference/react/useTransition), except that it does not provide the `isPending` flag to track whether a Transition is ongoing. You can call `startTransition` when `useTransition` is not available. For example, `startTransition` works outside components, such as from a data library.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `use(resource)`[](#use "Link for this heading")

Call `use` in your component to read the value of a resource like a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

    import { use } from 'react';function MessageComponent({ messagePromise }) {  const message = use(messagePromise);  const theme = use(ThemeContext);  // ...

Unlike React Hooks, `use` can be called within loops and conditional statements like `if`. Like React Hooks, the function that calls `use` must be a Component or Hook.

When called with a Promise, the `use` API integrates with [`Suspense`](/reference/react/Suspense) and [error boundaries](/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary). The component calling `use` _suspends_ while the Promise passed to `use` is pending. If the component that calls `use` is wrapped in a Suspense boundary, the fallback will be displayed. Once the Promise is resolved, the Suspense fallback is replaced by the rendered components using the data returned by the `use` API. If the Promise passed to `use` is rejected, the fallback of the nearest Error Boundary will be displayed.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `resource`: this is the source of the data you want to read a value from. A resource can be a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or a [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

The `use` API returns the value that was read from the resource like the resolved value of a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   The `use` API must be called inside a Component or a Hook.
*   When fetching data in a [Server Component](/reference/rsc/server-components), prefer `async` and `await` over `use`. `async` and `await` pick up rendering from the point where `await` was invoked, whereas `use` re-renders the component after the data is resolved.
*   Prefer creating Promises in [Server Components](/reference/rsc/server-components) and passing them to [Client Components](/reference/rsc/use-client) over creating Promises in Client Components. Promises created in Client Components are recreated on every render. Promises passed from a Server Component to a Client Component are stable across re-renders. [See this example](#streaming-data-from-server-to-client).

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Reading context with `use`[](#reading-context-with-use "Link for this heading")

When a [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is passed to `use`, it works similarly to [`useContext`](/reference/react/useContext). While `useContext` must be called at the top level of your component, `use` can be called inside conditionals like `if` and loops like `for`. `use` is preferred over `useContext` because it is more flexible.

    import { use } from 'react';function Button() {  const theme = use(ThemeContext);  // ...

`use` returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds **the closest context provider above** for that particular context.

To pass context to a `Button`, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider.

    function MyPage() {  return (    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">      <Form />    </ThemeContext.Provider>  );}function Form() {  // ... renders buttons inside ...}

It doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the `Button`. When a `Button` _anywhere_ inside of `Form` calls `use(ThemeContext)`, it will receive `"dark"` as the value.

Unlike [`useContext`](/reference/react/useContext), `use` can be called in conditionals and loops like `if`.

    function HorizontalRule({ show }) {  if (show) {    const theme = use(ThemeContext);    return <hr className={theme} />;  }  return false;}

`use` is called from inside a `if` statement, allowing you to conditionally read values from a Context.

### Pitfall

Like `useContext`, `use(context)` always looks for the closest context provider _above_ the component that calls it. It searches upwards and **does not** consider context providers in the component from which you’re calling `use(context)`.

### Streaming data from the server to the client[](#streaming-data-from-server-to-client "Link for Streaming data from the server to the client ")

Data can be streamed from the server to the client by passing a Promise as a prop from a Server Component to a Client Component.

    import { fetchMessage } from './lib.js';import { Message } from './message.js';export default function App() {  const messagePromise = fetchMessage();  return (    <Suspense fallback={<p>waiting for message...</p>}>      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />    </Suspense>  );}

The Client Component then takes the Promise it received as a prop and passes it to the `use` API. This allows the Client Component to read the value from the Promise that was initially created by the Server Component.

    // message.js'use client';import { use } from 'react';export function Message({ messagePromise }) {  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);  return <p>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p>;}

Because `Message` is wrapped in [`Suspense`](/reference/react/Suspense), the fallback will be displayed until the Promise is resolved. When the Promise is resolved, the value will be read by the `use` API and the `Message` component will replace the Suspense fallback.

message.js

message.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

"use client";

import { use, Suspense } from "react";

function Message({ messagePromise }) {
  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);
  return <p\>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p\>;
}

export function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback\={<p\>⌛Downloading message...</p\>}\>
      <Message messagePromise\={messagePromise} />
    </Suspense\>
  );
}

### Note

When passing a Promise from a Server Component to a Client Component, its resolved value must be serializable to pass between server and client. Data types like functions aren’t serializable and cannot be the resolved value of such a Promise.

##### Deep Dive

#### Should I resolve a Promise in a Server or Client Component?[](#resolve-promise-in-server-or-client-component "Link for Should I resolve a Promise in a Server or Client Component? ")

Show Details

A Promise can be passed from a Server Component to a Client Component and resolved in the Client Component with the `use` API. You can also resolve the Promise in a Server Component with `await` and pass the required data to the Client Component as a prop.

    export default async function App() {  const messageContent = await fetchMessage();  return <Message messageContent={messageContent} />}

But using `await` in a [Server Component](/reference/react/components#server-components) will block its rendering until the `await` statement is finished. Passing a Promise from a Server Component to a Client Component prevents the Promise from blocking the rendering of the Server Component.

### Dealing with rejected Promises[](#dealing-with-rejected-promises "Link for Dealing with rejected Promises ")

In some cases a Promise passed to `use` could be rejected. You can handle rejected Promises by either:

1.  [Displaying an error to users with an error boundary.](#displaying-an-error-to-users-with-error-boundary)
2.  [Providing an alternative value with `Promise.catch`](#providing-an-alternative-value-with-promise-catch)

### Pitfall

`use` cannot be called in a try-catch block. Instead of a try-catch block [wrap your component in an Error Boundary](#displaying-an-error-to-users-with-error-boundary), or [provide an alternative value to use with the Promise’s `.catch` method](#providing-an-alternative-value-with-promise-catch).

#### Displaying an error to users with an error boundary[](#displaying-an-error-to-users-with-error-boundary "Link for Displaying an error to users with an error boundary ")

If you’d like to display an error to your users when a Promise is rejected, you can use an [error boundary](/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary). To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the `use` API in an error boundary. If the Promise passed to `use` is rejected the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.

      <Suspense fallback\={<p\>⌛Downloading message...</p\>}\>
        <Message messagePromise\={messagePromise} />
      </Suspense\>
    </ErrorBoundary\>
  );
}

function Message({ messagePromise }) {
  const content = use(messagePromise);
  return <p\>Here is the message: {content}</p\>;
}

#### Providing an alternative value with `Promise.catch`[](#providing-an-alternative-value-with-promise-catch "Link for this heading")

If you’d like to provide an alternative value when the Promise passed to `use` is rejected you can use the Promise’s [`catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch) method.

    import { Message } from './message.js';export default function App() {  const messagePromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    reject();  }).catch(() => {    return "no new message found.";  });  return (    <Suspense fallback={<p>waiting for message...</p>}>      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />    </Suspense>  );}

To use the Promise’s `catch` method, call `catch` on the Promise object. `catch` takes a single argument: a function that takes an error message as an argument. Whatever is returned by the function passed to `catch` will be used as the resolved value of the Promise.

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### “Suspense Exception: This is not a real error!”[](#suspense-exception-error "Link for “Suspense Exception: This is not a real error!” ")

You are either calling `use` outside of a React Component or Hook function, or calling `use` in a try–catch block. If you are calling `use` inside a try–catch block, wrap your component in an error boundary, or call the Promise’s `catch` to catch the error and resolve the Promise with another value. [See these examples](#dealing-with-rejected-promises).

If you are calling `use` outside a React Component or Hook function, move the `use` call to a React Component or Hook function.

    function MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {  function download() {    // ❌ the function calling `use` is not a Component or Hook    const message = use(messagePromise);    // ...

Instead, call `use` outside any component closures, where the function that calls `use` is a Component or Hook.

    function MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {  // ✅ `use` is being called from a component.   const message = use(messagePromise);  // ...

### `taintObjectReference(message, object)`[](#taintobjectreference "Link for this heading")

Call `taintObjectReference` with an object to register it with React as something that should not be allowed to be passed to the Client as is:

    import {experimental_taintObjectReference} from 'react';experimental_taintObjectReference(  'Do not pass ALL environment variables to the client.',  process.env);

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `message`: The message you want to display if the object gets passed to a Client Component. This message will be displayed as a part of the Error that will be thrown if the object gets passed to a Client Component.
    
*   `object`: The object to be tainted. Functions and class instances can be passed to `taintObjectReference` as `object`. Functions and classes are already blocked from being passed to Client Components but the React’s default error message will be replaced by what you defined in `message`. When a specific instance of a Typed Array is passed to `taintObjectReference` as `object`, any other copies of the Typed Array will not be tainted.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`experimental_taintObjectReference` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Recreating or cloning a tainted object creates a new untainted object which may contain sensitive data. For example, if you have a tainted `user` object, `const userInfo = {name: user.name, ssn: user.ssn}` or `{...user}` will create new objects which are not tainted. `taintObjectReference` only protects against simple mistakes when the object is passed through to a Client Component unchanged.

### Pitfall

**Do not rely on just tainting for security.** Tainting an object doesn’t prevent leaking of every possible derived value. For example, the clone of a tainted object will create a new untainted object. Using data from a tainted object (e.g. `{secret: taintedObj.secret}`) will create a new value or object that is not tainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Prevent user data from unintentionally reaching the client[](#prevent-user-data-from-unintentionally-reaching-the-client "Link for Prevent user data from unintentionally reaching the client ")

A Client Component should never accept objects that carry sensitive data. Ideally, the data fetching functions should not expose data that the current user should not have access to. Sometimes mistakes happen during refactoring. To protect against these mistakes happening down the line we can “taint” the user object in our data API.

    import {experimental_taintObjectReference} from 'react';export async function getUser(id) {  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;  experimental_taintObjectReference(    'Do not pass the entire user object to the client. ' +      'Instead, pick off the specific properties you need for this use case.',    user,  );  return user;}

Now whenever anyone tries to pass this object to a Client Component, an error will be thrown with the passed in error message instead.

##### Deep Dive

#### Protecting against leaks in data fetching[](#protecting-against-leaks-in-data-fetching "Link for Protecting against leaks in data fetching ")

Show Details

If you’re running a Server Components environment that has access to sensitive data, you have to be careful not to pass objects straight through:

    // api.jsexport async function getUser(id) {  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;  return user;}

    import { getUser } from 'api.js';import { InfoCard } from 'components.js';export async function Profile(props) {  const user = await getUser(props.userId);  // DO NOT DO THIS  return <InfoCard user={user} />;}

    // components.js"use client";export async function InfoCard({ user }) {  return <div>{user.name}</div>;}

Ideally, the `getUser` should not expose data that the current user should not have access to. To prevent passing the `user` object to a Client Component down the line we can “taint” the user object:

    // api.jsimport {experimental_taintObjectReference} from 'react';export async function getUser(id) {  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;  experimental_taintObjectReference(    'Do not pass the entire user object to the client. ' +      'Instead, pick off the specific properties you need for this use case.',    user,  );  return user;}

Now if anyone tries to pass the `user` object to a Client Component, an error will be thrown with the passed in error message.

*   `message`: The message you want to display if `value` is passed to a Client Component. This message will be displayed as a part of the Error that will be thrown if `value` is passed to a Client Component.
    
*   `lifetime`: Any object that indicates how long `value` should be tainted. `value` will be blocked from being sent to any Client Component while this object still exists. For example, passing `globalThis` blocks the value for the lifetime of an app. `lifetime` is typically an object whose properties contains `value`.
    
*   `value`: A string, bigint or TypedArray. `value` must be a unique sequence of characters or bytes with high entropy such as a cryptographic token, private key, hash, or a long password. `value` will be blocked from being sent to any Client Component.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`experimental_taintUniqueValue` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Deriving new values from tainted values can compromise tainting protection. New values created by uppercasing tainted values, concatenating tainted string values into a larger string, converting tainted values to base64, substringing tainted values, and other similar transformations are not tainted unless you explicitly call `taintUniqueValue` on these newly created values.
*   Do not use `taintUniqueValue` to protect low-entropy values such as PIN codes or phone numbers. If any value in a request is controlled by an attacker, they could infer which value is tainted by enumerating all possible values of the secret.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Prevent a token from being passed to Client Components[](#prevent-a-token-from-being-passed-to-client-components "Link for Prevent a token from being passed to Client Components ")

To ensure that sensitive information such as passwords, session tokens, or other unique values do not inadvertently get passed to Client Components, the `taintUniqueValue` function provides a layer of protection. When a value is tainted, any attempt to pass it to a Client Component will result in an error.

The `lifetime` argument defines the duration for which the value remains tainted. For values that should remain tainted indefinitely, objects like [`globalThis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis) or `process` can serve as the `lifetime` argument. These objects have a lifespan that spans the entire duration of your app’s execution.

    import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';experimental_taintUniqueValue(  'Do not pass a user password to the client.',  globalThis,  process.env.SECRET_KEY);

If the tainted value’s lifespan is tied to a object, the `lifetime` should be the object that encapsulates the value. This ensures the tainted value remains protected for the lifetime of the encapsulating object.

    import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';export async function getUser(id) {  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;  experimental_taintUniqueValue(    'Do not pass a user session token to the client.',    user,    user.session.token  );  return user;}

In this example, the `user` object serves as the `lifetime` argument. If this object gets stored in a global cache or is accessible by another request, the session token remains tainted.

### Pitfall

**Do not rely solely on tainting for security.** Tainting a value doesn’t block every possible derived value. For example, creating a new value by upper casing a tainted string will not taint the new value.

    import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';const password = 'correct horse battery staple';experimental_taintUniqueValue(  'Do not pass the password to the client.',  globalThis,  password);const uppercasePassword = password.toUpperCase() // `uppercasePassword` is not tainted

In this example, the constant `password` is tainted. Then `password` is used to create a new value `uppercasePassword` by calling the `toUpperCase` method on `password`. The newly created `uppercasePassword` is not tainted.

Other similar ways of deriving new values from tainted values like concatenating it into a larger string, converting it to base64, or returning a substring create untained values.

Tainting only protects against simple mistakes like explicitly passing secret values to the client. Mistakes in calling the `taintUniqueValue` like using a global store outside of React, without the corresponding lifetime object, can cause the tainted value to become untainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.

##### Deep Dive

#### Using `server-only` and `taintUniqueValue` to prevent leaking secrets[](#using-server-only-and-taintuniquevalue-to-prevent-leaking-secrets "Link for this heading")

Show Details

If you’re running a Server Components environment that has access to private keys or passwords such as database passwords, you have to be careful not to pass that to a Client Component.

    export async function Dashboard(props) {  // DO NOT DO THIS  return <Overview password={process.env.API_PASSWORD} />;}

    "use client";import {useEffect} from '...'export async function Overview({ password }) {  useEffect(() => {    const headers = { Authorization: password };    fetch(url, { headers }).then(...);  }, [password]);  ...}

This example would leak the secret API token to the client. If this API token can be used to access data this particular user shouldn’t have access to, it could lead to a data breach.

Ideally, secrets like this are abstracted into a single helper file that can only be imported by trusted data utilities on the server. The helper can even be tagged with [`server-only`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) to ensure that this file isn’t imported on the client.

    import "server-only";export function fetchAPI(url) {  const headers = { Authorization: process.env.API_PASSWORD };  return fetch(url, { headers });}

Sometimes mistakes happen during refactoring and not all of your colleagues might know about this. To protect against this mistakes happening down the line we can “taint” the actual password:

    import "server-only";import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';experimental_taintUniqueValue(  'Do not pass the API token password to the client. ' +    'Instead do all fetches on the server.'  process,  process.env.API_PASSWORD);

Now whenever anyone tries to pass this password to a Client Component, or send the password to a Client Component with a Server Function, an error will be thrown with message you defined when you called `taintUniqueValue`.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Adding the cause of a transition[](#adding-the-cause-of-a-transition "Link for Adding the cause of a transition ")

Call `addTransitionType` inside of `startTransition` to indicate the cause of a transition:

    import { startTransition, unstable_addTransitionType } from 'react';function Submit({action) {  function handleClick() {    startTransition(() => {      unstable_addTransitionType('submit-click');      action();    });  }  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;}

When you call addTransitionType inside the scope of startTransition, React will associate submit-click as one of the causes for the Transition.

Currently, Transition Types can be used to customize different animations based on what caused the Transition. You have three different ways to choose from for how to use them:

*   [Customize animations using browser view transition types](#customize-animations-using-browser-view-transition-types)
*   [Customize animations using `View Transition` Class](#customize-animations-using-view-transition-class)
*   [Customize animations using `ViewTransition` events](#customize-animations-using-viewtransition-events)

In the future, we plan to support more use cases for using the cause of a transition.

* * *

### Customize animations using browser view transition types[](#customize-animations-using-browser-view-transition-types "Link for Customize animations using browser view transition types ")

When a [`ViewTransition`](/reference/react/ViewTransition) activates from a transition, React adds all the Transition Types as browser [view transition types](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-view-transitions-2/#active-view-transition-pseudo-examples) to the element.

This allows you to customize different animations based on CSS scopes:

    function Component() {  return (    <ViewTransition>      <div>Hello</div>    </ViewTransition>  );}startTransition(() => {  unstable_addTransitionType('my-transition-type');  setShow(true);});

    :root:active-view-transition-type(my-transition-type) {  &::view-transition-...(...) {    ...  }}

* * *

### Customize animations using `View Transition` Class[](#customize-animations-using-view-transition-class "Link for this heading")

You can customize animations for an activated `ViewTransition` based on type by passing an object to the View Transition Class:

    function Component() {  return (    <ViewTransition enter={{      'my-transition-type': 'my-transition-class',    }}>      <div>Hello</div>    </ViewTransition>  );}// ...startTransition(() => {  unstable_addTransitionType('my-transition-type');  setState(newState);});

If multiple types match, then they’re joined together. If no types match then the special “default” entry is used instead. If any type has the value “none” then that wins and the ViewTransition is disabled (not assigned a name).

These can be combined with enter/exit/update/layout/share props to match based on kind of trigger and Transition Type.

    <ViewTransition enter={{  'navigation-back': 'enter-right',  'navigation-forward': 'enter-left',}}exit={{  'navigation-back': 'exit-right',  'navigation-forward': 'exit-left',}}>

* * *

### Customize animations using `ViewTransition` events[](#customize-animations-using-viewtransition-events "Link for this heading")

You can imperatively customize animations for an activated `ViewTransition` based on type using View Transition events:

    <ViewTransition onUpdate={(inst, types) => {  if (types.includes('navigation-back')) {    ...  } else if (types.includes('navigation-forward')) {    ...  } else {    ...  }}}>

This allows you to pick different imperative Animations based on the cause.

Built-in React DOM Hooks[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==============================================================

The `react-dom` package contains Hooks that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). These Hooks are not supported in non-browser environments like iOS, Android, or Windows applications. If you are looking for Hooks that are supported in web browsers _and other environments_ see [the React Hooks page](/reference/react). This page lists all the Hooks in the `react-dom` package.

Form Hooks[](#form-hooks "Link for Form Hooks ")
------------------------------------------------

_Forms_ let you create interactive controls for submitting information. To manage forms in your components, use one of these Hooks:

*   [`useFormStatus`](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) allows you to make updates to the UI based on the status of a form.

    function Form({ action }) {  async function increment(n) {    return n + 1;  }  const [count, incrementFormAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);  return (    <form action={action}>      <button formAction={incrementFormAction}>Count: {count}</button>      <Button />    </form>  );}function Button() {  const { pending } = useFormStatus();  return (    <button disabled={pending} type="submit">      Submit    </button>  );}

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `useFormStatus()`[](#use-form-status "Link for this heading")

The `useFormStatus` Hook provides status information of the last form submission.

    import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";import action from './actions';function Submit() {  const status = useFormStatus();  return <button disabled={status.pending}>Submit</button>}export default function App() {  return (    <form action={action}>      <Submit />    </form>  );}

To get status information, the `Submit` component must be rendered within a `<form>`. The Hook returns information like the `pending` property which tells you if the form is actively submitting.

In the above example, `Submit` uses this information to disable `<button>` presses while the form is submitting.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`useFormStatus` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

A `status` object with the following properties:

*   `pending`: A boolean. If `true`, this means the parent `<form>` is pending submission. Otherwise, `false`.
    
*   `data`: An object implementing the [`FormData interface`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) that contains the data the parent `<form>` is submitting. If there is no active submission or no parent `<form>`, it will be `null`.
    
*   `method`: A string value of either `'get'` or `'post'`. This represents whether the parent `<form>` is submitting with either a `GET` or `POST` [HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods). By default, a `<form>` will use the `GET` method and can be specified by the [`method`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#method) property.
    

*   `action`: A reference to the function passed to the `action` prop on the parent `<form>`. If there is no parent `<form>`, the property is `null`. If there is a URI value provided to the `action` prop, or no `action` prop specified, `status.action` will be `null`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   The `useFormStatus` Hook must be called from a component that is rendered inside a `<form>`.
*   `useFormStatus` will only return status information for a parent `<form>`. It will not return status information for any `<form>` rendered in that same component or children components.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Display a pending state during form submission[](#display-a-pending-state-during-form-submission "Link for Display a pending state during form submission ")

To display a pending state while a form is submitting, you can call the `useFormStatus` Hook in a component rendered in a `<form>` and read the `pending` property returned.

Here, we use the `pending` property to indicate the form is submitting.

### Pitfall

##### `useFormStatus` will not return status information for a `<form>` rendered in the same component.[](#useformstatus-will-not-return-status-information-for-a-form-rendered-in-the-same-component "Link for this heading")

The `useFormStatus` Hook only returns status information for a parent `<form>` and not for any `<form>` rendered in the same component calling the Hook, or child components.

    function Form() {  // 🚩 `pending` will never be true  // useFormStatus does not track the form rendered in this component  const { pending } = useFormStatus();  return <form action={submit}></form>;}

Instead call `useFormStatus` from inside a component that is located inside `<form>`.

    function Submit() {  // ✅ `pending` will be derived from the form that wraps the Submit component  const { pending } = useFormStatus();   return <button disabled={pending}>...</button>;}function Form() {  // This is the <form> `useFormStatus` tracks  return (    <form action={submit}>      <Submit />    </form>  );}

### Read the form data being submitted[](#read-form-data-being-submitted "Link for Read the form data being submitted ")

You can use the `data` property of the status information returned from `useFormStatus` to display what data is being submitted by the user.

Here, we have a form where users can request a username. We can use `useFormStatus` to display a temporary status message confirming what username they have requested.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### `status.pending` is never `true`[](#pending-is-never-true "Link for this heading")

`useFormStatus` will only return status information for a parent `<form>`.

If the component that calls `useFormStatus` is not nested in a `<form>`, `status.pending` will always return `false`. Verify `useFormStatus` is called in a component that is a child of a `<form>` element.

`useFormStatus` will not track the status of a `<form>` rendered in the same component. See [Pitfall](#useformstatus-will-not-return-status-information-for-a-form-rendered-in-the-same-component) for more details.

React supports all of the browser built-in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element) components.

* * *

Common components[](#common-components "Link for Common components ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the built-in browser components support some props and events.

*   [Common components (e.g. `<div>`)](/reference/react-dom/components/common)

This includes React-specific props like `ref` and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

* * *

Form components[](#form-components "Link for Form components ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

These built-in browser components accept user input:

*   [`<input>`](/reference/react-dom/components/input)
*   [`<select>`](/reference/react-dom/components/select)
*   [`<textarea>`](/reference/react-dom/components/textarea)

They are special in React because passing the `value` prop to them makes them _[controlled.](/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)_

* * *

Resource and Metadata Components[](#resource-and-metadata-components "Link for Resource and Metadata Components ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These built-in browser components let you load external resources or annotate the document with metadata:

*   [`<script>`](/reference/react-dom/components/script)
*   [`<style>`](/reference/react-dom/components/style)
*   [`<title>`](/reference/react-dom/components/title)

They are special in React because React can render them into the document head, suspend while resources are loading, and enact other behaviors that are described on the reference page for each specific component.

### Note

Similar to the [DOM standard,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) React uses a `camelCase` convention for prop names. For example, you’ll write `tabIndex` instead of `tabindex`. You can convert existing HTML to JSX with an [online converter.](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx)

* * *

### Custom HTML elements[](#custom-html-elements "Link for Custom HTML elements ")

If you render a tag with a dash, like `<my-element>`, React will assume you want to render a [custom HTML element.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) In React, rendering custom elements works differently from rendering built-in browser tags:

*   All custom element props are serialized to strings and are always set using attributes.
*   Custom elements accept `class` rather than `className`, and `for` rather than `htmlFor`.

If you render a built-in browser HTML element with an [`is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/is) attribute, it will also be treated as a custom element.

### Note

[A future version of React will include more comprehensive support for custom elements.](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11347#issuecomment-1122275286)

You can try it by upgrading React packages to the most recent experimental version:

*   `react@experimental`
*   `react-dom@experimental`

Experimental versions of React may contain bugs. Don’t use them in production.

* * *

All SVG components[](#all-svg-components "Link for All SVG components ")

### Note

Similar to the [DOM standard,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) React uses a `camelCase` convention for prop names. For example, you’ll write `tabIndex` instead of `tabindex`. You can convert existing SVG to JSX with an [online converter.](https://transform.tools/)

Namespaced attributes also have to be written without the colon:

*   `xlink:actuate` becomes `xlinkActuate`.
*   `xlink:arcrole` becomes `xlinkArcrole`.
*   `xlink:href` becomes `xlinkHref`.
*   `xlink:role` becomes `xlinkRole`.
*   `xlink:show` becomes `xlinkShow`.
*   `xlink:title` becomes `xlinkTitle`.
*   `xlink:type` becomes `xlinkType`.
*   `xml:base` becomes `xmlBase`.
*   `xml:lang` becomes `xmlLang`.
*   `xml:space` becomes `xmlSpace`.
*   `xmlns:xlink` becomes `xmlnsXlink`.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### Common components (e.g. `<div>`)[](#common "Link for this heading")

    <div className="wrapper">Some content</div>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#common-props "Link for Props ")

These special React props are supported for all built-in components:

*   `children`: A React node (an element, a string, a number, [a portal,](/reference/react-dom/createPortal) an empty node like `null`, `undefined` and booleans, or an array of other React nodes). Specifies the content inside the component. When you use JSX, you will usually specify the `children` prop implicitly by nesting tags like `<div><span /></div>`.
    
*   `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: An object of the form `{ __html: '<p>some html</p>' }` with a raw HTML string inside. Overrides the [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) property of the DOM node and displays the passed HTML inside. This should be used with extreme caution! If the HTML inside isn’t trusted (for example, if it’s based on user data), you risk introducing an [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability. [Read more about using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.](#dangerously-setting-the-inner-html)
    
*   `ref`: A ref object from [`useRef`](/reference/react/useRef) or [`createRef`](/reference/react/createRef), or a [`ref` callback function,](#ref-callback) or a string for [legacy refs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs) Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. [Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.](#manipulating-a-dom-node-with-a-ref)
    
*   `suppressContentEditableWarning`: A boolean. If `true`, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have `children` and `contentEditable={true}` (which normally do not work together). Use this if you’re building a text input library that manages the `contentEditable` content manually.
    
*   `suppressHydrationWarning`: A boolean. If you use [server rendering,](/reference/react-dom/server) normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. In some rare cases (like timestamps), it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. If you set `suppressHydrationWarning` to `true`, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. [Read about suppressing hydration errors.](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#suppressing-unavoidable-hydration-mismatch-errors)
    
*   `style`: An object with CSS styles, for example `{ fontWeight: 'bold', margin: 20 }`. Similarly to the DOM [`style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style) property, the CSS property names need to be written as `camelCase`, for example `fontWeight` instead of `font-weight`. You can pass strings or numbers as values. If you pass a number, like `width: 100`, React will automatically append `px` (“pixels”) to the value unless it’s a [unitless property.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/81d4ee9ca5c405dce62f64e61506b8e155f38d8d/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/shared/CSSProperty.js#L8-L57) We recommend using `style` only for dynamic styles where you don’t know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with `className` is more efficient. [Read more about `className` and `style`.](#applying-css-styles)
    

These standard DOM props are also supported for all built-in components:

*   [`accessKey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey): A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. [Not generally recommended.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey#accessibility_concerns)
*   [`aria-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes): ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes) for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML.
*   [`autoCapitalize`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocapitalize): A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized.
*   [`className`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className): A string. Specifies the element’s CSS class name. [Read more about applying CSS styles.](#applying-css-styles)
*   [`contentEditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable): A boolean. If `true`, the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly. This is used to implement rich text input libraries like [Lexical.](https://lexical.dev/) React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with `contentEditable={true}` because React will not be able to update its content after user edits.
*   [`data-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*): Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example `data-fruit="banana"`. In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead.
*   [`dir`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir): Either `'ltr'` or `'rtl'`. Specifies the text direction of the element.
*   [`draggable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/draggable): A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of [HTML Drag and Drop API.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)
*   [`enterKeyHint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/enterKeyHint): A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.
*   [`htmlFor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor): A string. For [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) and [`<output>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output), lets you [associate the label with some control.](/reference/react-dom/components/input#providing-a-label-for-an-input) Same as [`for` HTML attribute.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/for) React uses the standard DOM property names (`htmlFor`) instead of HTML attribute names.
*   [`hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden): A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden.
*   [`id`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id): A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with [`useId`](/reference/react/useId) to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component.
*   [`is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/is): A string. If specified, the component will behave like a [custom element.](/reference/react-dom/components#custom-html-elements)
*   [`inputMode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode): A string. Specifies what kind of keyboard to display (for example, text, number or telephone).
*   [`itemProp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop): A string. Specifies which property the element represents for structured data crawlers.
*   [`lang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang): A string. Specifies the language of the element.
*   [`onAnimationEnd`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationend_event): An [`AnimationEvent` handler](#animationevent-handler) function. Fires when a CSS animation completes.
*   `onAnimationEndCapture`: A version of `onAnimationEnd` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`onAnimationIteration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationiteration_event): An [`AnimationEvent` handler](#animationevent-handler) function. Fires when an iteration of a CSS animation ends, and another one begins.
*   `onAnimationIterationCapture`: A version of `onAnimationIteration` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)

*   `onAuxClickCapture`: A version of `onAuxClick` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   `onBeforeInput`: An [`InputEvent` handler](#inputevent-handler) function. Fires before the value of an editable element is modified. React does _not_ yet use the native [`beforeinput`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/beforeinput_event) event, and instead attempts to polyfill it using other events.
*   `onBeforeInputCapture`: A version of `onBeforeInput` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   `onBlur`: A [`FocusEvent` handler](#focusevent-handler) function. Fires when an element lost focus. Unlike the built-in browser [`blur`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/blur_event) event, in React the `onBlur` event bubbles.
*   `onBlurCapture`: A version of `onBlur` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)

* * *

### `ref` callback function[](#ref-callback "Link for this heading")

Instead of a ref object (like the one returned by [`useRef`](/reference/react/useRef#manipulating-the-dom-with-a-ref)), you may pass a function to the `ref` attribute.

    <div ref={(node) => {  console.log('Attached', node);  return () => {    console.log('Clean up', node)  }}}>

[See an example of using the `ref` callback.](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs#how-to-manage-a-list-of-refs-using-a-ref-callback)

When the `<div>` DOM node is added to the screen, React will call your `ref` callback with the DOM `node` as the argument. When that `<div>` DOM node is removed, React will call your the cleanup function returned from the callback.

React will also call your `ref` callback whenever you pass a _different_ `ref` callback. In the above example, `(node) => { ... }` is a different function on every render. When your component re-renders, the _previous_ function will be called with `null` as the argument, and the _next_ function will be called with the DOM node.

#### Parameters[](#ref-callback-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `node`: A DOM node. React will pass you the DOM node when the ref gets attached. Unless you pass the same function reference for the `ref` callback on every render, the callback will get temporarily cleanup and re-create during every re-render of the component.

### Note

#### React 19 added cleanup functions for `ref` callbacks.[](#react-19-added-cleanup-functions-for-ref-callbacks "Link for this heading")

To support backwards compatibility, if a cleanup function is not returned from the `ref` callback, `node` will be called with `null` when the `ref` is detached. This behavior will be removed in a future version.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

*   **optional** `cleanup function`: When the `ref` is detached, React will call the cleanup function. If a function is not returned by the `ref` callback, React will call the callback again with `null` as the argument when the `ref` gets detached. This behavior will be removed in a future version.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   When Strict Mode is on, React will **run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle** before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.
*   When you pass a _different_ `ref` callback, React will call the _previous_ callback’s cleanup function if provided. If no cleanup function is defined, the `ref` callback will be called with `null` as the argument. The _next_ function will be called with the DOM node.

* * *

### React event object[](#react-event-object "Link for React event object ")

Your event handlers will receive a _React event object._ It is also sometimes known as a “synthetic event”.

    <button onClick={e => {  console.log(e); // React event object}} />

It conforms to the same standard as the underlying DOM events, but fixes some browser inconsistencies.

Some React events do not map directly to the browser’s native events. For example in `onMouseLeave`, `e.nativeEvent` will point to a `mouseout` event. The specific mapping is not part of the public API and may change in the future. If you need the underlying browser event for some reason, read it from `e.nativeEvent`.

#### Properties[](#react-event-object-properties "Link for Properties ")

React event objects implement some of the standard [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) properties:

*   [`bubbles`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/bubbles): A boolean. Returns whether the event bubbles through the DOM.
*   [`cancelable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/cancelable): A boolean. Returns whether the event can be canceled.
*   [`currentTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget): A DOM node. Returns the node to which the current handler is attached in the React tree.
*   [`defaultPrevented`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/defaultPrevented): A boolean. Returns whether `preventDefault` was called.
*   [`eventPhase`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/eventPhase): A number. Returns which phase the event is currently in.
*   [`isTrusted`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted): A boolean. Returns whether the event was initiated by user.
*   [`target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target): A DOM node. Returns the node on which the event has occurred (which could be a distant child).
*   [`timeStamp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/timeStamp): A number. Returns the time when the event occurred.

Additionally, React event objects provide these properties:

*   `nativeEvent`: A DOM [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event). The original browser event object.

#### Methods[](#react-event-object-methods "Link for Methods ")

React event objects implement some of the standard [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) methods:

*   [`preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault): Prevents the default browser action for the event.
*   [`stopPropagation()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation): Stops the event propagation through the React tree.

Additionally, React event objects provide these methods:

*   `isDefaultPrevented()`: Returns a boolean value indicating whether `preventDefault` was called.
*   `isPropagationStopped()`: Returns a boolean value indicating whether `stopPropagation` was called.
*   `persist()`: Not used with React DOM. With React Native, call this to read event’s properties after the event.
*   `isPersistent()`: Not used with React DOM. With React Native, returns whether `persist` has been called.

#### Caveats[](#react-event-object-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   The values of `currentTarget`, `eventPhase`, `target`, and `type` reflect the values your React code expects. Under the hood, React attaches event handlers at the root, but this is not reflected in React event objects. For example, `e.currentTarget` may not be the same as the underlying `e.nativeEvent.currentTarget`. For polyfilled events, `e.type` (React event type) may differ from `e.nativeEvent.type` (underlying type).

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Applying CSS styles[](#applying-css-styles "Link for Applying CSS styles ")

In React, you specify a CSS class with [`className`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className) It works like the `class` attribute in HTML:

    <img className="avatar" />

Then you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:

    /* In your CSS */.avatar {  border-radius: 50%;}

React does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a [`<link>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) tag to your HTML. If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project.

Sometimes, the style values depend on data. Use the `style` attribute to pass some styles dynamically:

    <img  className="avatar"  style={{    width: user.imageSize,    height: user.imageSize  }}/>

In the above example, `style={{}}` is not a special syntax, but a regular `{}` object inside the `style={ }` [JSX curly braces.](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces) We recommend only using the `style` attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.

App.jsAvatar.js

Avatar.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function Avatar({ user }) {
  return (
    <img
      src\={user.imageUrl}
      alt\={'Photo of ' + user.name}
      className\="avatar"
      style\={{
        width: user.imageSize,
        height: user.imageSize
      }}
    />
  );
}

##### Deep Dive

#### How to apply multiple CSS classes conditionally?[](#how-to-apply-multiple-css-classes-conditionally "Link for How to apply multiple CSS classes conditionally? ")

Show Details

To apply CSS classes conditionally, you need to produce the `className` string yourself using JavaScript.

For example, `className={'row ' + (isSelected ? 'selected': '')}` will produce either `className="row"` or `className="row selected"` depending on whether `isSelected` is `true`.

To make this more readable, you can use a tiny helper library like [`classnames`:](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)

    import cn from 'classnames';function Row({ isSelected }) {  return (    <div className={cn('row', isSelected && 'selected')}>      ...    </div>  );}

It is especially convenient if you have multiple conditional classes:

    import cn from 'classnames';function Row({ isSelected, size }) {  return (    <div className={cn('row', {      selected: isSelected,      large: size === 'large',      small: size === 'small',    })}>      ...    </div>  );}

### Manipulating a DOM node with a ref[](#manipulating-a-dom-node-with-a-ref "Link for Manipulating a DOM node with a ref ")

Sometimes, you’ll need to get the browser DOM node associated with a tag in JSX. For example, if you want to focus an `<input>` when a button is clicked, you need to call [`focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) on the browser `<input>` DOM node.

To obtain the browser DOM node for a tag, [declare a ref](/reference/react/useRef) and pass it as the `ref` attribute to that tag:

    import { useRef } from 'react';export default function Form() {  const inputRef = useRef(null);  // ...  return (    <input ref={inputRef} />    // ...

React will put the DOM node into `inputRef.current` after it’s been rendered to the screen.

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <\>
      <input ref\={inputRef} />
      <button onClick\={handleClick}\>
        Focus the input
      </button\>
    </\>
  );
}

### Dangerously setting the inner HTML[](#dangerously-setting-the-inner-html "Link for Dangerously setting the inner HTML ")

You can pass a raw HTML string to an element like so:

    const markup = { __html: '<p>some raw html</p>' };return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;

**This is dangerous. As with the underlying DOM [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) property, you must exercise extreme caution! Unless the markup is coming from a completely trusted source, it is trivial to introduce an [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability this way.**

For example, if you use a Markdown library that converts Markdown to HTML, you trust that its parser doesn’t contain bugs, and the user only sees their own input, you can display the resulting HTML like this:

package.jsonApp.jsMarkdownPreview.js

MarkdownPreview.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Remarkable } from 'remarkable';

const md = new Remarkable();

function renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown) {
  // This is ONLY safe because the output HTML
  // is shown to the same user, and because you
  // trust this Markdown parser to not have bugs.
  const renderedHTML = md.render(markdown);
  return {\_\_html: renderedHTML};
}

export default function MarkdownPreview({ markdown }) {
  const markup = renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown);
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML\={markup} />;
}

Show more

The `{__html}` object should be created as close to where the HTML is generated as possible, like the above example does in the `renderMarkdownToHTML` function. This ensures that all raw HTML being used in your code is explicitly marked as such, and that only variables that you expect to contain HTML are passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. It is not recommended to create the object inline like `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: markup}} />`.

To see why rendering arbitrary HTML is dangerous, replace the code above with this:

    const post = {  // Imagine this content is stored in the database.  content: `<img src="" onerror='alert("you were hacked")'>`};export default function MarkdownPreview() {  // 🔴 SECURITY HOLE: passing untrusted input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML  const markup = { __html: post.content };  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;}

The code embedded in the HTML will run. A hacker could use this security hole to steal user information or to perform actions on their behalf. **Only use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with trusted and sanitized data.**

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<form>`[](#form "Link for this heading")

To create interactive controls for submitting information, render the [built-in browser `<form>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form).

    <form action={search}>    <input name="query" />    <button type="submit">Search</button></form>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<form>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

[`action`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#action): a URL or function. When a URL is passed to `action` the form will behave like the HTML form component. When a function is passed to `action` the function will handle the form submission. The function passed to `action` may be async and will be called with a single argument containing the [form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) of the submitted form. The `action` prop can be overridden by a `formAction` attribute on a `<button>`, `<input type="submit">`, or `<input type="image">` component.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   When a function is passed to `action` or `formAction` the HTTP method will be POST regardless of value of the `method` prop.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Handle form submission on the client[](#handle-form-submission-on-the-client "Link for Handle form submission on the client ")

Pass a function to the `action` prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted. [`formData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) will be passed to the function as an argument so you can access the data submitted by the form. This differs from the conventional [HTML action](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#action), which only accepts URLs. After the `action` function succeeds, all uncontrolled field elements in the form are reset.

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function Search() {
  function search(formData) {
    const query = formData.get("query");
    alert(\`You searched for '${query}'\`);
  }
  return (
    <form action\={search}\>
      <input name\="query" />
      <button type\="submit"\>Search</button\>
    </form\>
  );
}

### Handle form submission with a Server Function[](#handle-form-submission-with-a-server-function "Link for Handle form submission with a Server Function ")

Render a `<form>` with an input and submit button. Pass a Server Function (a function marked with [`'use server'`](/reference/rsc/use-server)) to the `action` prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted.

Passing a Server Function to `<form action>` allow users to submit forms without JavaScript enabled or before the code has loaded. This is beneficial to users who have a slow connection, device, or have JavaScript disabled and is similar to the way forms work when a URL is passed to the `action` prop.

You can use hidden form fields to provide data to the `<form>`’s action. The Server Function will be called with the hidden form field data as an instance of [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData).

    import { updateCart } from './lib.js';function AddToCart({productId}) {  async function addToCart(formData) {    'use server'    const productId = formData.get('productId')    await updateCart(productId)  }  return (    <form action={addToCart}>        <input type="hidden" name="productId" value={productId} />        <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>    </form>  );}

In lieu of using hidden form fields to provide data to the `<form>`’s action, you can call the `bind` method to supply it with extra arguments. This will bind a new argument (`productId`) to the function in addition to the `formData` that is passed as an argument to the function.

    import { updateCart } from './lib.js';function AddToCart({productId}) {  async function addToCart(productId, formData) {    "use server";    await updateCart(productId)  }  const addProductToCart = addToCart.bind(null, productId);  return (    <form action={addProductToCart}>      <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>    </form>  );}

When `<form>` is rendered by a [Server Component](/reference/rsc/use-client), and a [Server Function](/reference/rsc/server-functions) is passed to the `<form>`’s `action` prop, the form is [progressively enhanced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).

### Display a pending state during form submission[](#display-a-pending-state-during-form-submission "Link for Display a pending state during form submission ")

To display a pending state when a form is being submitted, you can call the `useFormStatus` Hook in a component rendered in a `<form>` and read the `pending` property returned.

Here, we use the `pending` property to indicate the form is submitting.

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";
import { submitForm } from "./actions.js";

function Submit() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return (
    <button type\="submit" disabled\={pending}\>
      {pending ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
    </button\>
  );
}

function Form({ action }) {
  return (
    <form action\={action}\>
      <Submit />
    </form\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return <Form action\={submitForm} />;
}

To learn more about the `useFormStatus` Hook see the [reference documentation](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus).

### Optimistically updating form data[](#optimistically-updating-form-data "Link for Optimistically updating form data ")

The `useOptimistic` Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.

For example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the `useOptimistic` Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.

### Handling form submission errors[](#handling-form-submission-errors "Link for Handling form submission errors ")

In some cases the function called by a `<form>`’s `action` prop throws an error. You can handle these errors by wrapping `<form>` in an Error Boundary. If the function called by a `<form>`’s `action` prop throws an error, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.

### Display a form submission error without JavaScript[](#display-a-form-submission-error-without-javascript "Link for Display a form submission error without JavaScript ")

Displaying a form submission error message before the JavaScript bundle loads for progressive enhancement requires that:

1.  `<form>` be rendered by a [Server Component](/reference/rsc/use-client)
2.  the function passed to the `<form>`’s `action` prop be a [Server Function](/reference/rsc/server-functions)
3.  the `useActionState` Hook be used to display the error message

`useActionState` takes two parameters: a [Server Function](/reference/rsc/server-functions) and an initial state. `useActionState` returns two values, a state variable and an action. The action returned by `useActionState` should be passed to the `action` prop of the form. The state variable returned by `useActionState` can be used to display an error message. The value returned by the Server Function passed to `useActionState` will be used to update the state variable.

### Handling multiple submission types[](#handling-multiple-submission-types "Link for Handling multiple submission types ")

Forms can be designed to handle multiple submission actions based on the button pressed by the user. Each button inside a form can be associated with a distinct action or behavior by setting the `formAction` prop.

When a user taps a specific button, the form is submitted, and a corresponding action, defined by that button’s attributes and action, is executed. For instance, a form might submit an article for review by default but have a separate button with `formAction` set to save the article as a draft.

### `<input>`[](#input "Link for this heading")

To display an input, render the [built-in browser `<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) component.

    <input name="myInput" />

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<input>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

*   [`formAction`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#formaction): A string or function. Overrides the parent `<form action>` for `type="submit"` and `type="image"`. When a URL is passed to `action` the form will behave like a standard HTML form. When a function is passed to `formAction` the function will handle the form submission. See [`<form action>`](/reference/react-dom/components/form#props).

You can [make an input controlled](#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable) by passing one of these props:

*   [`checked`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement#checked): A boolean. For a checkbox input or a radio button, controls whether it is selected.
*   [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement#value): A string. For a text input, controls its text. (For a radio button, specifies its form data.)

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Checkboxes need `checked` (or `defaultChecked`), not `value` (or `defaultValue`).
*   If a text input receives a string `value` prop, it will be [treated as controlled.](#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)
*   If a checkbox or a radio button receives a boolean `checked` prop, it will be [treated as controlled.](#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)
*   An input can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.
*   An input cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.
*   Every controlled input needs an `onChange` event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.

### Displaying inputs of different types[](#displaying-inputs-of-different-types "Link for Displaying inputs of different types ")

To display an input, render an `<input>` component. By default, it will be a text input. You can pass `type="checkbox"` for a checkbox, `type="radio"` for a radio button, [or one of the other input types.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types)

### Providing a label for an input[](#providing-a-label-for-an-input "Link for Providing a label for an input ")

Typically, you will place every `<input>` inside a [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that input. When the user clicks the label, the browser will automatically focus the input. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the associated input.

If you can’t nest `<input>` into a `<label>`, associate them by passing the same ID to `<input id>` and [`<label htmlFor>`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor) To avoid conflicts between multiple instances of one component, generate such an ID with [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId)

### Reading the input values when submitting a form[](#reading-the-input-values-when-submitting-a-form "Link for Reading the input values when submitting a form ")

Add a [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) around your inputs with a [`<button type="submit">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) inside. It will call your `<form onSubmit>` event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling `e.preventDefault()`. Read the form data with [`new FormData(e.target)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData).

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function MyForm() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    // Prevent the browser from reloading the page
    e.preventDefault();

    // Read the form data
    const form = e.target;
    const formData = new FormData(form);

    // You can pass formData as a fetch body directly:
    fetch('/some-api', { method: form.method, body: formData });

    // Or you can work with it as a plain object:
    const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());
    console.log(formJson);
  }

  return (
    <form method\="post" onSubmit\={handleSubmit}\>
      <label\>
        Text input: <input name\="myInput" defaultValue\="Some initial value" />
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <label\>
        Checkbox: <input type\="checkbox" name\="myCheckbox" defaultChecked\={true} />

### Note

Give a `name` to every `<input>`, for example `<input name="firstName" defaultValue="Taylor" />`. The `name` you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example `{ firstName: "Taylor" }`.

### Pitfall

By default, a `<button>` inside a `<form>` without a `type` attribute will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom `Button` React component, consider using [`<button type="button">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) instead of `<button>` (with no type). Then, to be explicit, use `<button type="submit">` for buttons that _are_ supposed to submit the form.

### Controlling an input with a state variable[](#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable "Link for Controlling an input with a state variable ")

An input like `<input />` is _uncontrolled._ Even if you [pass an initial value](#providing-an-initial-value-for-an-input) like `<input defaultValue="Initial text" />`, your JSX only specifies the initial value. It does not control what the value should be right now.

**To render a _controlled_ input, pass the `value` prop to it (or `checked` for checkboxes and radios).** React will force the input to always have the `value` you passed. Usually, you would do this by declaring a [state variable:](/reference/react/useState)

    function Form() {  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); // Declare a state variable...  // ...  return (    <input      value={firstName} // ...force the input's value to match the state variable...      onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any edits!    />  );}

A controlled input makes sense if you needed state anyway—for example, to re-render your UI on every edit:

    function Form() {  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');  return (    <>      <label>        First name:        <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />      </label>      {firstName !== '' && <p>Your name is {firstName}.</p>}      ...

It’s also useful if you want to offer multiple ways to adjust the input state (for example, by clicking a button):

    function Form() {  // ...  const [age, setAge] = useState('');  const ageAsNumber = Number(age);  return (    <>      <label>        Age:        <input          value={age}          onChange={e => setAge(e.target.value)}          type="number"        />        <button onClick={() => setAge(ageAsNumber + 10)}>          Add 10 years        </button>

The `value` you pass to controlled components should not be `undefined` or `null`. If you need the initial value to be empty (such as with the `firstName` field below), initialize your state variable to an empty string (`''`).

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {

  const \[age, setAge\] = useState('20');
  const ageAsNumber = Number(age);
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        First name:
        <input
          value\={firstName}
          onChange\={e \=> setFirstName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label\>
      <label\>
        Age:
        <input
          value\={age}
          onChange\={e \=> setAge(e.target.value)}
          type\="number"
        />
        <button onClick\={() \=> setAge(ageAsNumber + 10)}\>
          Add 10 years
        </button\>
      </label\>
      {firstName !== '' &&
        <p\>Your name is {firstName}.</p\>
      }
      {ageAsNumber > 0 &&
        <p\>Your age is {ageAsNumber}.</p\>
      }
    </\>

### Pitfall

**If you pass `value` without `onChange`, it will be impossible to type into the input.** When you control an input by passing some `value` to it, you _force_ it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a `value` but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the `onChange` event handler, React will revert the input after every keystroke back to the `value` that you specified.

* * *

### Optimizing re-rendering on every keystroke[](#optimizing-re-rendering-on-every-keystroke "Link for Optimizing re-rendering on every keystroke ")

When you use a controlled input, you set the state on every keystroke. If the component containing your state re-renders a large tree, this can get slow. There’s a few ways you can optimize re-rendering performance.

For example, suppose you start with a form that re-renders all page content on every keystroke:

    function App() {  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');  return (    <>      <form>        <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />      </form>      <PageContent />    </>  );}

Since `<PageContent />` doesn’t rely on the input state, you can move the input state into its own component:

    function App() {  return (    <>      <SignupForm />      <PageContent />    </>  );}function SignupForm() {  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');  return (    <form>      <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />    </form>  );}

This significantly improves performance because now only `SignupForm` re-renders on every keystroke.

If there is no way to avoid re-rendering (for example, if `PageContent` depends on the search input’s value), [`useDeferredValue`](/reference/react/useDeferredValue#deferring-re-rendering-for-a-part-of-the-ui) lets you keep the controlled input responsive even in the middle of a large re-render.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My text input doesn’t update when I type into it[](#my-text-input-doesnt-update-when-i-type-into-it "Link for My text input doesn’t update when I type into it ")

If you render an input with `value` but no `onChange`, you will see an error in the console:

    // 🔴 Bug: controlled text input with no onChange handler<input value={something} />

Console

You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`.

As the error message suggests, if you only wanted to [specify the _initial_ value,](#providing-an-initial-value-for-an-input) pass `defaultValue` instead:

    // ✅ Good: uncontrolled input with an initial value<input defaultValue={something} />

If you want [to control this input with a state variable,](#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable) specify an `onChange` handler:

    // ✅ Good: controlled input with onChange<input value={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.value)} />

If the value is intentionally read-only, add a `readOnly` prop to suppress the error:

    // ✅ Good: readonly controlled input without on change<input value={something} readOnly={true} />

* * *

### My checkbox doesn’t update when I click on it[](#my-checkbox-doesnt-update-when-i-click-on-it "Link for My checkbox doesn’t update when I click on it ")

If you render a checkbox with `checked` but no `onChange`, you will see an error in the console:

    // 🔴 Bug: controlled checkbox with no onChange handler<input type="checkbox" checked={something} />

Console

You provided a `checked` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultChecked`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`.

As the error message suggests, if you only wanted to [specify the _initial_ value,](#providing-an-initial-value-for-an-input) pass `defaultChecked` instead:

    // ✅ Good: uncontrolled checkbox with an initial value<input type="checkbox" defaultChecked={something} />

If you want [to control this checkbox with a state variable,](#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable) specify an `onChange` handler:

    // ✅ Good: controlled checkbox with onChange<input type="checkbox" checked={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.checked)} />

### Pitfall

You need to read `e.target.checked` rather than `e.target.value` for checkboxes.

If the checkbox is intentionally read-only, add a `readOnly` prop to suppress the error:

    // ✅ Good: readonly controlled input without on change<input type="checkbox" checked={something} readOnly={true} />

* * *

### My input caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke[](#my-input-caret-jumps-to-the-beginning-on-every-keystroke "Link for My input caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke ")

If you [control an input,](#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable) you must update its state variable to the input’s value from the DOM during `onChange`.

You can’t update it to something other than `e.target.value` (or `e.target.checked` for checkboxes):

    function handleChange(e) {  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input to something other than e.target.value  setFirstName(e.target.value.toUpperCase());}

You also can’t update it asynchronously:

    function handleChange(e) {  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input asynchronously  setTimeout(() => {    setFirstName(e.target.value);  }, 100);}

To fix your code, update it synchronously to `e.target.value`:

    function handleChange(e) {  // ✅ Updating a controlled input to e.target.value synchronously  setFirstName(e.target.value);}

If this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the input gets removed and re-added from the DOM on every keystroke. This can happen if you’re accidentally [resetting state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) on every re-render, for example if the input or one of its parents always receives a different `key` attribute, or if you nest component function definitions (which is not supported and causes the “inner” component to always be considered a different tree).

* * *

### I’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled”[](#im-getting-an-error-a-component-is-changing-an-uncontrolled-input-to-be-controlled "Link for I’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled” ")

If you provide a `value` to the component, it must remain a string throughout its lifetime.

You cannot pass `value={undefined}` first and later pass `value="some string"` because React won’t know whether you want the component to be uncontrolled or controlled. A controlled component should always receive a string `value`, not `null` or `undefined`.

If your `value` is coming from an API or a state variable, it might be initialized to `null` or `undefined`. In that case, either set it to an empty string (`''`) initially, or pass `value={someValue ?? ''}` to ensure `value` is a string.

Similarly, if you pass `checked` to a checkbox, ensure it’s always a boolean.

The [built-in browser `<option>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) lets you render an option inside a [`<select>`](/reference/react-dom/components/select) box.

    <select>  <option value="someOption">Some option</option>  <option value="otherOption">Other option</option></select>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<option>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

Additionally, `<option>` supports these props:

*   [`disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option#disabled): A boolean. If `true`, the option will not be selectable and will appear dimmed.
*   [`label`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option#label): A string. Specifies the meaning of the option. If not specified, the text inside the option is used.
*   [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option#value): The value to be used [when submitting the parent `<select>` in a form](/reference/react-dom/components/select#reading-the-select-box-value-when-submitting-a-form) if this option is selected.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   React does not support the `selected` attribute on `<option>`. Instead, pass this option’s `value` to the parent [`<select defaultValue>`](/reference/react-dom/components/select#providing-an-initially-selected-option) for an uncontrolled select box, or [`<select value>`](/reference/react-dom/components/select#controlling-a-select-box-with-a-state-variable) for a controlled select.

---------------------------------------------

### `<select>`[](#select "Link for this heading")

To display a select box, render the [built-in browser `<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) component.

    <select>  <option value="someOption">Some option</option>  <option value="otherOption">Other option</option></select>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<select>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

You can [make a select box controlled](#controlling-a-select-box-with-a-state-variable) by passing a `value` prop:

*   `value`: A string (or an array of strings for [`multiple={true}`](#enabling-multiple-selection)). Controls which option is selected. Every value string match the `value` of some `<option>` nested inside the `<select>`.

When you pass `value`, you must also pass an `onChange` handler that updates the passed value.

If your `<select>` is uncontrolled, you may pass the `defaultValue` prop instead:

*   `defaultValue`: A string (or an array of strings for [`multiple={true}`](#enabling-multiple-selection)). Specifies [the initially selected option.](#providing-an-initially-selected-option)

These `<select>` props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled select boxes:

*   [`autoComplete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#autocomplete): A string. Specifies one of the possible [autocomplete behaviors.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#values)
*   [`autoFocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#autofocus): A boolean. If `true`, React will focus the element on mount.
*   `children`: `<select>` accepts [`<option>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option), [`<optgroup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup), and [`<datalist>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) components as children. You can also pass your own components as long as they eventually render one of the allowed components. If you pass your own components that eventually render `<option>` tags, each `<option>` you render must have a `value`.
*   [`disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#disabled): A boolean. If `true`, the select box will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.
*   [`form`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#form): A string. Specifies the `id` of the `<form>` this select box belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.
*   [`multiple`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#multiple): A boolean. If `true`, the browser allows [multiple selection.](#enabling-multiple-selection)
*   [`name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#name): A string. Specifies the name for this select box that’s [submitted with the form.](#reading-the-select-box-value-when-submitting-a-form)
*   `onChange`: An [`Event` handler](/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handler) function. Required for [controlled select boxes.](#controlling-a-select-box-with-a-state-variable) Fires immediately when the user picks a different option. Behaves like the browser [`input` event.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event)
*   `onChangeCapture`: A version of `onChange` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`onInput`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event): An [`Event` handler](/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handler) function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use `onChange` instead which works similarly.
*   `onInputCapture`: A version of `onInput` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`onInvalid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/invalid_event): An [`Event` handler](/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handler) function. Fires if an input fails validation on form submit. Unlike the built-in `invalid` event, the React `onInvalid` event bubbles.
*   `onInvalidCapture`: A version of `onInvalid` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`required`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#required): A boolean. If `true`, the value must be provided for the form to submit.
*   [`size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#size): A number. For `multiple={true}` selects, specifies the preferred number of initially visible items.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Unlike in HTML, passing a `selected` attribute to `<option>` is not supported. Instead, use [`<select defaultValue>`](#providing-an-initially-selected-option) for uncontrolled select boxes and [`<select value>`](#controlling-a-select-box-with-a-state-variable) for controlled select boxes.
*   If a select box receives a `value` prop, it will be [treated as controlled.](#controlling-a-select-box-with-a-state-variable)
*   A select box can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.
*   A select box cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.
*   Every controlled select box needs an `onChange` event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.

    </label\>
  );
}

* * *

### Providing a label for a select box[](#providing-a-label-for-a-select-box "Link for Providing a label for a select box ")

Typically, you will place every `<select>` inside a [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that select box. When the user clicks the label, the browser will automatically focus the select box. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the select box.

If you can’t nest `<select>` into a `<label>`, associate them by passing the same ID to `<select id>` and [`<label htmlFor>`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor) To avoid conflicts between multiple instances of one component, generate such an ID with [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId)

### Providing an initially selected option[](#providing-an-initially-selected-option "Link for Providing an initially selected option ")

By default, the browser will select the first `<option>` in the list. To select a different option by default, pass that `<option>`’s `value` as the `defaultValue` to the `<select>` element.

App.js

### Enabling multiple selection[](#enabling-multiple-selection "Link for Enabling multiple selection ")

Pass `multiple={true}` to the `<select>` to let the user select multiple options. In that case, if you also specify `defaultValue` to choose the initially selected options, it must be an array.

### Reading the select box value when submitting a form[](#reading-the-select-box-value-when-submitting-a-form "Link for Reading the select box value when submitting a form ")

Add a [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) around your select box with a [`<button type="submit">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) inside. It will call your `<form onSubmit>` event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling `e.preventDefault()`. Read the form data with [`new FormData(e.target)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData).

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function EditPost() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    // Prevent the browser from reloading the page
    e.preventDefault();
    // Read the form data
    const form = e.target;
    const formData = new FormData(form);
    // You can pass formData as a fetch body directly:
    fetch('/some-api', { method: form.method, body: formData });
    // You can generate a URL out of it, as the browser does by default:
    console.log(new URLSearchParams(formData).toString());
    // You can work with it as a plain object.
    const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());
    console.log(formJson); // (!) This doesn't include multiple select values
    // Or you can get an array of name-value pairs.
    console.log(\[...formData.entries()\]);
  }

  return (
    <form method\="post" onSubmit\={handleSubmit}\>
      <label\>
        Pick your favorite fruit:
        <select name\="selectedFruit" defaultValue\="orange"\>
          <option value\="apple"\>Apple</option\>
          <option value\="banana"\>Banana</option\>
          <option value\="orange"\>Orange</option\>
        </select\>
      </label\>
      <label\>
        Pick all your favorite vegetables:
        <select
          name\="selectedVegetables"
          multiple\={true}
          defaultValue\={\['corn', 'tomato'\]}
        \>
          <option value\="cucumber"\>Cucumber</option\>
          <option value\="corn"\>Corn</option\>
          <option value\="tomato"\>Tomato</option\>

      <button type\="reset"\>Reset</button\>
      <button type\="submit"\>Submit</button\>
    </form\>
  );
}

Show more

### Note

Give a `name` to your `<select>`, for example `<select name="selectedFruit" />`. The `name` you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example `{ selectedFruit: "orange" }`.

If you use `<select multiple={true}>`, the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) you’ll read from the form will include each selected value as a separate name-value pair. Look closely at the console logs in the example above.

### Pitfall

By default, _any_ `<button>` inside a `<form>` will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom `Button` React component, consider returning [`<button type="button">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/button) instead of `<button>`. Then, to be explicit, use `<button type="submit">` for buttons that _are_ supposed to submit the form.

### Controlling a select box with a state variable[](#controlling-a-select-box-with-a-state-variable "Link for Controlling a select box with a state variable ")

A select box like `<select />` is _uncontrolled._ Even if you [pass an initially selected value](#providing-an-initially-selected-option) like `<select defaultValue="orange" />`, your JSX only specifies the initial value, not the value right now.

**To render a _controlled_ select box, pass the `value` prop to it.** React will force the select box to always have the `value` you passed. Typically, you will control a select box by declaring a [state variable:](/reference/react/useState)

    function FruitPicker() {  const [selectedFruit, setSelectedFruit] = useState('orange'); // Declare a state variable...  // ...  return (    <select      value={selectedFruit} // ...force the select's value to match the state variable...      onChange={e => setSelectedFruit(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any change!    >      <option value="apple">Apple</option>      <option value="banana">Banana</option>      <option value="orange">Orange</option>    </select>  );}

This is useful if you want to re-render some part of the UI in response to every selection.

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FruitPicker() {
  const \[selectedFruit, setSelectedFruit\] = useState('orange');
  const \[selectedVegs, setSelectedVegs\] = useState(\['corn', 'tomato'\]);
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Pick a fruit:
        <select
          value\={selectedFruit}
          onChange\={e \=> setSelectedFruit(e.target.value)}
        \>

            const options = \[...e.target.selectedOptions\];
            const values = options.map(option \=> option.value);
            setSelectedVegs(values);
          }}

      <p\>Your favorite vegetables: {selectedVegs.join(', ')}</p\>
    </\>
  );
}

### Pitfall

**If you pass `value` without `onChange`, it will be impossible to select an option.** When you control a select box by passing some `value` to it, you _force_ it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a `value` but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the `onChange` event handler, React will revert the select box after every keystroke back to the `value` that you specified.

Unlike in HTML, passing a `selected` attribute to an individual `<option>` is not supported.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<textarea>`[](#textarea "Link for this heading")

To display a text area, render the [built-in browser `<textarea>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) component.

    <textarea name="postContent" />

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<textarea>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

You can [make a text area controlled](#controlling-a-text-area-with-a-state-variable) by passing a `value` prop:

*   `value`: A string. Controls the text inside the text area.

When you pass `value`, you must also pass an `onChange` handler that updates the passed value.

If your `<textarea>` is uncontrolled, you may pass the `defaultValue` prop instead:

*   `defaultValue`: A string. Specifies [the initial value](#providing-an-initial-value-for-a-text-area) for a text area.

These `<textarea>` props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled text areas:

*   [`autoComplete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#autocomplete): Either `'on'` or `'off'`. Specifies the autocomplete behavior.
*   [`autoFocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#autofocus): A boolean. If `true`, React will focus the element on mount.
*   `children`: `<textarea>` does not accept children. To set the initial value, use `defaultValue`.
*   [`cols`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#cols): A number. Specifies the default width in average character widths. Defaults to `20`.
*   [`disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#disabled): A boolean. If `true`, the input will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.
*   [`form`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#form): A string. Specifies the `id` of the `<form>` this input belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.
*   [`maxLength`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#maxlength): A number. Specifies the maximum length of text.
*   [`minLength`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#minlength): A number. Specifies the minimum length of text.
*   [`name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#name): A string. Specifies the name for this input that’s [submitted with the form.](#reading-the-textarea-value-when-submitting-a-form)
*   `onChange`: An [`Event` handler](/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handler) function. Required for [controlled text areas.](#controlling-a-text-area-with-a-state-variable) Fires immediately when the input’s value is changed by the user (for example, it fires on every keystroke). Behaves like the browser [`input` event.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event)
*   `onChangeCapture`: A version of `onChange` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`onInput`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event): An [`Event` handler](/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handler) function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use `onChange` instead which works similarly.
*   `onInputCapture`: A version of `onInput` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`onInvalid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/invalid_event): An [`Event` handler](/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handler) function. Fires if an input fails validation on form submit. Unlike the built-in `invalid` event, the React `onInvalid` event bubbles.
*   `onInvalidCapture`: A version of `onInvalid` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`onSelect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement/select_event): An [`Event` handler](/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handler) function. Fires after the selection inside the `<textarea>` changes. React extends the `onSelect` event to also fire for empty selection and on edits (which may affect the selection).
*   `onSelectCapture`: A version of `onSelect` that fires in the [capture phase.](/learn/responding-to-events#capture-phase-events)
*   [`placeholder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#placeholder): A string. Displayed in a dimmed color when the text area value is empty.
*   [`readOnly`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#readonly): A boolean. If `true`, the text area is not editable by the user.
*   [`required`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#required): A boolean. If `true`, the value must be provided for the form to submit.
*   [`rows`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#rows): A number. Specifies the default height in average character heights. Defaults to `2`.
*   [`wrap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#wrap): Either `'hard'`, `'soft'`, or `'off'`. Specifies how the text should be wrapped when submitting a form.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Passing children like `<textarea>something</textarea>` is not allowed. [Use `defaultValue` for initial content.](#providing-an-initial-value-for-a-text-area)
*   If a text area receives a string `value` prop, it will be [treated as controlled.](#controlling-a-text-area-with-a-state-variable)
*   A text area can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.
*   A text area cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.
*   Every controlled text area needs an `onChange` event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Displaying a text area[](#displaying-a-text-area "Link for Displaying a text area ")

Render `<textarea>` to display a text area. You can specify its default size with the [`rows`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#rows) and [`cols`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#cols) attributes, but by default the user will be able to resize it. To disable resizing, you can specify `resize: none` in the CSS.

      Write your post:
      <textarea name\="postContent" rows\={4} cols\={40} />
    </label\>
  );
}

* * *

### Providing a label for a text area[](#providing-a-label-for-a-text-area "Link for Providing a label for a text area ")

Typically, you will place every `<textarea>` inside a [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that text area. When the user clicks the label, the browser will focus the text area. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the text area.

If you can’t nest `<textarea>` into a `<label>`, associate them by passing the same ID to `<textarea id>` and [`<label htmlFor>`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor) To avoid conflicts between instances of one component, generate such an ID with [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId)

### Providing an initial value for a text area[](#providing-an-initial-value-for-a-text-area "Link for Providing an initial value for a text area ")

You can optionally specify the initial value for the text area. Pass it as the `defaultValue` string.

      <textarea

        rows\={4}
        cols\={40}
      />
    </label\>
  );
}

### Pitfall

Unlike in HTML, passing initial text like `<textarea>Some content</textarea>` is not supported.

* * *

### Reading the text area value when submitting a form[](#reading-the-text-area-value-when-submitting-a-form "Link for Reading the text area value when submitting a form ")

Add a [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) around your textarea with a [`<button type="submit">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) inside. It will call your `<form onSubmit>` event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling `e.preventDefault()`. Read the form data with [`new FormData(e.target)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData).

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function EditPost() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    // Prevent the browser from reloading the page
    e.preventDefault();

    // Read the form data
    const form = e.target;
    const formData = new FormData(form);

    // You can pass formData as a fetch body directly:
    fetch('/some-api', { method: form.method, body: formData });

    // Or you can work with it as a plain object:
    const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());
    console.log(formJson);
  }

  return (
    <form method\="post" onSubmit\={handleSubmit}\>
      <label\>
        Post title: <input name\="postTitle" defaultValue\="Biking" />
      </label\>
      <label\>
        Edit your post:
        <textarea
          name\="postContent"
          defaultValue\="I really enjoyed biking yesterday!"
          rows\={4}
          cols\={40}
        />
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <button type\="reset"\>Reset edits</button\>
      <button type\="submit"\>Save post</button\>
    </form\>
  );
}

Show more

### Note

Give a `name` to your `<textarea>`, for example `<textarea name="postContent" />`. The `name` you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example `{ postContent: "Your post" }`.

### Pitfall

By default, _any_ `<button>` inside a `<form>` will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom `Button` React component, consider returning [`<button type="button">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/button) instead of `<button>`. Then, to be explicit, use `<button type="submit">` for buttons that _are_ supposed to submit the form.

* * *

### Controlling a text area with a state variable[](#controlling-a-text-area-with-a-state-variable "Link for Controlling a text area with a state variable ")

A text area like `<textarea />` is _uncontrolled._ Even if you [pass an initial value](#providing-an-initial-value-for-a-text-area) like `<textarea defaultValue="Initial text" />`, your JSX only specifies the initial value, not the value right now.

**To render a _controlled_ text area, pass the `value` prop to it.** React will force the text area to always have the `value` you passed. Typically, you will control a text area by declaring a [state variable:](/reference/react/useState)

    function NewPost() {  const [postContent, setPostContent] = useState(''); // Declare a state variable...  // ...  return (    <textarea      value={postContent} // ...force the input's value to match the state variable...      onChange={e => setPostContent(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any edits!    />  );}

This is useful if you want to re-render some part of the UI in response to every keystroke.

  "devDependencies": {}

### Pitfall

**If you pass `value` without `onChange`, it will be impossible to type into the text area.** When you control a text area by passing some `value` to it, you _force_ it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a `value` but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the `onChange` event handler, React will revert the text area after every keystroke back to the `value` that you specified.

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My text area doesn’t update when I type into it[](#my-text-area-doesnt-update-when-i-type-into-it "Link for My text area doesn’t update when I type into it ")

If you render a text area with `value` but no `onChange`, you will see an error in the console:

    // 🔴 Bug: controlled text area with no onChange handler<textarea value={something} />

Console

You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either `onChange` or `readOnly`.

As the error message suggests, if you only wanted to [specify the _initial_ value,](#providing-an-initial-value-for-a-text-area) pass `defaultValue` instead:

    // ✅ Good: uncontrolled text area with an initial value<textarea defaultValue={something} />

If you want [to control this text area with a state variable,](#controlling-a-text-area-with-a-state-variable) specify an `onChange` handler:

    // ✅ Good: controlled text area with onChange<textarea value={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.value)} />

If the value is intentionally read-only, add a `readOnly` prop to suppress the error:

    // ✅ Good: readonly controlled text area without on change<textarea value={something} readOnly={true} />

* * *

### My text area caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke[](#my-text-area-caret-jumps-to-the-beginning-on-every-keystroke "Link for My text area caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke ")

If you [control a text area,](#controlling-a-text-area-with-a-state-variable) you must update its state variable to the text area’s value from the DOM during `onChange`.

You can’t update it to something other than `e.target.value`:

    function handleChange(e) {  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input to something other than e.target.value  setFirstName(e.target.value.toUpperCase());}

You also can’t update it asynchronously:

    function handleChange(e) {  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input asynchronously  setTimeout(() => {    setFirstName(e.target.value);  }, 100);}

To fix your code, update it synchronously to `e.target.value`:

    function handleChange(e) {  // ✅ Updating a controlled input to e.target.value synchronously  setFirstName(e.target.value);}

If this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the text area gets removed and re-added from the DOM on every keystroke. This can happen if you’re accidentally [resetting state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) on every re-render. For example, this can happen if the text area or one of its parents always receives a different `key` attribute, or if you nest component definitions (which is not allowed in React and causes the “inner” component to remount on every render).

* * *

### I’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled”[](#im-getting-an-error-a-component-is-changing-an-uncontrolled-input-to-be-controlled "Link for I’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled” ")

If you provide a `value` to the component, it must remain a string throughout its lifetime.

You cannot pass `value={undefined}` first and later pass `value="some string"` because React won’t know whether you want the component to be uncontrolled or controlled. A controlled component should always receive a string `value`, not `null` or `undefined`.

If your `value` is coming from an API or a state variable, it might be initialized to `null` or `undefined`. In that case, either set it to an empty string (`''`) initially, or pass `value={someValue ?? ''}` to ensure `value` is a string.

### `<link>`[](#link "Link for this heading")

To link to external resources such as stylesheets, fonts, and icons, or to annotate the document with link metadata, render the [built-in browser `<link>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link). You can render `<link>` from any component and React will [in most cases](#special-rendering-behavior) place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.

    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<link>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

*   `rel`: a string, required. Specifies the [relationship to the resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel). React [treats links with `rel="stylesheet"` differently](#special-rendering-behavior) from other links.

These props apply when `rel="stylesheet"`:

*   `precedence`: a string. Tells React where to rank the `<link>` DOM node relative to others in the document `<head>`, which determines which stylesheet can override the other. React will infer that precedence values it discovers first are “lower” and precedence values it discovers later are “higher”. Many style systems can work fine using a single precedence value because style rules are atomic. Stylesheets with the same precedence go together whether they are `<link>` or inline `<style>` tags or loaded using [`preinit`](/reference/react-dom/preinit) functions.
*   `media`: a string. Restricts the stylesheet to a certain [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries).
*   `title`: a string. Specifies the name of an [alternative stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets).

These props apply when `rel="stylesheet"` but disable React’s [special treatment of stylesheets](#special-rendering-behavior):

*   `disabled`: a boolean. Disables the stylesheet.
*   `onError`: a function. Called when the stylesheet fails to load.
*   `onLoad`: a function. Called when the stylesheet finishes being loaded.

These props apply when `rel="preload"` or `rel="modulepreload"`:

*   `as`: a string. The type of resource. Its possible values are `audio`, `document`, `embed`, `fetch`, `font`, `image`, `object`, `script`, `style`, `track`, `video`, `worker`.
*   `imageSrcSet`: a string. Applicable only when `as="image"`. Specifies the [source set of the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).
*   `imageSizes`: a string. Applicable only when `as="image"`. Specifies the [sizes of the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

These props apply when `rel="icon"` or `rel="apple-touch-icon"`:

*   `sizes`: a string. The [sizes of the icon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

These props apply in all cases:

*   `href`: a string. The URL of the linked resource.
*   `crossOrigin`: a string. The [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) to use. Its possible values are `anonymous` and `use-credentials`. It is required when `as` is set to `"fetch"`.
*   `referrerPolicy`: a string. The [Referrer header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#referrerpolicy) to send when fetching. Its possible values are `no-referrer-when-downgrade` (the default), `no-referrer`, `origin`, `origin-when-cross-origin`, and `unsafe-url`.
*   `fetchPriority`: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are `auto` (the default), `high`, and `low`.
*   `hrefLang`: a string. The language of the linked resource.
*   `integrity`: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to [verify its authenticity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
*   `type`: a string. The MIME type of the linked resource.

Props that are **not recommended** for use with React:

*   `blocking`: a string. If set to `"render"`, instructs the browser not to render the page until the stylesheet is loaded. React provides more fine-grained control using Suspense.

#### Special rendering behavior[](#special-rendering-behavior "Link for Special rendering behavior ")

React will always place the DOM element corresponding to the `<link>` component within the document’s `<head>`, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The `<head>` is the only valid place for `<link>` to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render `<link>` components itself.

There are a few exceptions to this:

*   If the `<link>` has a `rel="stylesheet"` prop, then it has to also have a `precedence` prop to get this special behavior. This is because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the `precedence` prop. If the `precedence` prop is omitted, there is no special behavior.
*   If the `<link>` has an [`itemProp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop) prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t apply to the document but instead represents metadata about a specific part of the page.
*   If the `<link>` has an `onLoad` or `onError` prop, because in that case you are managing the loading of the linked resource manually within your React component.

#### Special behavior for stylesheets[](#special-behavior-for-stylesheets "Link for Special behavior for stylesheets ")

In addition, if the `<link>` is to a stylesheet (namely, it has `rel="stylesheet"` in its props), React treats it specially in the following ways:

*   The component that renders `<link>` will [suspend](/reference/react/Suspense) while the stylesheet is loading.
*   If multiple components render links to the same stylesheet, React will de-duplicate them and only put a single link into the DOM. Two links are considered the same if they have the same `href` prop.

There are two exception to this special behavior:

*   If the link doesn’t have a `precedence` prop, there is no special behavior, because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the `precedence` prop.
*   If you supply any of the `onLoad`, `onError`, or `disabled` props, there is no special behavior, because these props indicate that you are managing the loading of the stylesheet manually within your component.

This special treatment comes with two caveats:

*   React will ignore changes to props after the link has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)
*   React may leave the link in the DOM even after the component that rendered it has been unmounted.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Linking to related resources[](#linking-to-related-resources "Link for Linking to related resources ")

You can annotate the document with links to related resources such as an icon, canonical URL, or pingback. React will place this metadata within the document `<head>` regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered.

  );
}

### Linking to a stylesheet[](#linking-to-a-stylesheet "Link for Linking to a stylesheet ")

If a component depends on a certain stylesheet in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a link to that stylesheet within the component. Your component will [suspend](/reference/react/Suspense) while the stylesheet is loading. You must supply the `precedence` prop, which tells React where to place this stylesheet relative to others — stylesheets with higher precedence can override those with lower precedence.

### Note

When you want to use a stylesheet, it can be beneficial to call the [preinit](/reference/react-dom/preinit) function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the stylesheet earlier than if you just render a `<link>` component, for example by sending an [HTTP Early Hints response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/103).

### Controlling stylesheet precedence[](#controlling-stylesheet-precedence "Link for Controlling stylesheet precedence ")

Stylesheets can conflict with each other, and when they do, the browser goes with the one that comes later in the document. React lets you control the order of stylesheets with the `precedence` prop. In this example, three components render stylesheets, and the ones with the same precedence are grouped together in the `<head>`.

function SecondComponent() {

}

function ThirdComponent() {
  return <link rel\="stylesheet" href\="third.css" precedence\="first" />;
}

Note the `precedence` values themselves are arbitrary and their naming is up to you. React will infer that precedence values it discovers first are “lower” and precedence values it discovers later are “higher”.

### Deduplicated stylesheet rendering[](#deduplicated-stylesheet-rendering "Link for Deduplicated stylesheet rendering ")

If you render the same stylesheet from multiple components, React will place only a single `<link>` in the document head.

### Annotating specific items within the document with links[](#annotating-specific-items-within-the-document-with-links "Link for Annotating specific items within the document with links ")

You can use the `<link>` component with the `itemProp` prop to annotate specific items within the document with links to related resources. In this case, React will _not_ place these annotations within the document `<head>` but will place them like any other React component.

<meta>[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
============================================

The [built-in browser `<meta>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) lets you add metadata to the document.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `<meta>`[](#meta "Link for this heading")

To add document metadata, render the [built-in browser `<meta>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta). You can render `<meta>` from any component and React will always place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.

    <meta name="keywords" content="React, JavaScript, semantic markup, html" />

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<meta>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

It should have _exactly one_ of the following props: `name`, `httpEquiv`, `charset`, `itemProp`. The `<meta>` component does something different depending on which of these props is specified.

*   `name`: a string. Specifies the [kind of metadata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name) to be attached to the document.
*   `charset`: a string. Specifies the character set used by the document. The only valid value is `"utf-8"`.
*   `httpEquiv`: a string. Specifies a directive for processing the document.
*   `itemProp`: a string. Specifies metadata about a particular item within the document rather than the document as a whole.
*   `content`: a string. Specifies the metadata to be attached when used with the `name` or `itemProp` props or the behavior of the directive when used with the `httpEquiv` prop.

#### Special rendering behavior[](#special-rendering-behavior "Link for Special rendering behavior ")

React will always place the DOM element corresponding to the `<meta>` component within the document’s `<head>`, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The `<head>` is the only valid place for `<meta>` to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render `<meta>` components itself.

There is one exception to this: if `<meta>` has an [`itemProp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop) prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t represent metadata about the document but rather metadata about a specific part of the page.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Annotating the document with metadata[](#annotating-the-document-with-metadata "Link for Annotating the document with metadata ")

You can annotate the document with metadata such as keywords, a summary, or the author’s name. React will place this metadata within the document `<head>` regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered.

    <meta name="author" content="John Smith" /><meta name="keywords" content="React, JavaScript, semantic markup, html" /><meta name="description" content="API reference for the <meta> component in React DOM" />

You can render the `<meta>` component from any component. React will put a `<meta>` DOM node in the document `<head>`.

### `<script>`[](#script "Link for this heading")

To add inline or external scripts to your document, render the [built-in browser `<script>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script). You can render `<script>` from any component and React will [in certain cases](#special-rendering-behavior) place the corresponding DOM element in the document head and de-duplicate identical scripts.

    <script> alert("hi!") </script><script src="script.js" />

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<script>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

It should have _either_ `children` or a `src` prop.

*   `children`: a string. The source code of an inline script.
*   `src`: a string. The URL of an external script.

Other supported props:

*   `async`: a boolean. Allows the browser to defer execution of the script until the rest of the document has been processed — the preferred behavior for performance.
*   `crossOrigin`: a string. The [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) to use. Its possible values are `anonymous` and `use-credentials`.
*   `fetchPriority`: a string. Lets the browser rank scripts in priority when fetching multiple scripts at the same time. Can be `"high"`, `"low"`, or `"auto"` (the default).
*   `integrity`: a string. A cryptographic hash of the script, to [verify its authenticity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
*   `noModule`: a boolean. Disables the script in browsers that support ES modules — allowing for a fallback script for browsers that do not.
*   `nonce`: a string. A cryptographic [nonce to allow the resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) when using a strict Content Security Policy.
*   `referrer`: a string. Says [what Referer header to send](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#referrerpolicy) when fetching the script and any resources that the script fetches in turn.
*   `type`: a string. Says whether the script is a [classic script, ES module, or import map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type).

Props that disable React’s [special treatment of scripts](#special-rendering-behavior):

*   `onError`: a function. Called when the script fails to load.
*   `onLoad`: a function. Called when the script finishes being loaded.

Props that are **not recommended** for use with React:

*   `blocking`: a string. If set to `"render"`, instructs the browser not to render the page until the scriptsheet is loaded. React provides more fine-grained control using Suspense.
*   `defer`: a string. Prevents the browser from executing the script until the document is done loading. Not compatible with streaming server-rendered components. Use the `async` prop instead.

#### Special rendering behavior[](#special-rendering-behavior "Link for Special rendering behavior ")

React can move `<script>` components to the document’s `<head>` and de-duplicate identical scripts.

To opt into this behavior, provide the `src` and `async={true}` props. React will de-duplicate scripts if they have the same `src`. The `async` prop must be true to allow scripts to be safely moved.

This special treatment comes with two caveats:

*   React will ignore changes to props after the script has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)
*   React may leave the script in the DOM even after the component that rendered it has been unmounted. (This has no effect as scripts just execute once when they are inserted into the DOM.)

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Rendering an external script[](#rendering-an-external-script "Link for Rendering an external script ")

If a component depends on certain scripts in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a `<script>` within the component. However, the component might be committed before the script has finished loading. You can start depending on the script content once the `load` event is fired e.g. by using the `onLoad` prop.

React will de-duplicate scripts that have the same `src`, inserting only one of them into the DOM even if multiple components render it.

### Note

When you want to use a script, it can be beneficial to call the [preinit](/reference/react-dom/preinit) function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the script earlier than if you just render a `<script>` component, for example by sending an [HTTP Early Hints response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/103).

### Rendering an inline script[](#rendering-an-inline-script "Link for Rendering an inline script ")

To include an inline script, render the `<script>` component with the script source code as its children. Inline scripts are not de-duplicated or moved to the document `<head>`.

### `<style>`[](#style "Link for this heading")

To add inline styles to your document, render the [built-in browser `<style>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style). You can render `<style>` from any component and React will [in certain cases](#special-rendering-behavior) place the corresponding DOM element in the document head and de-duplicate identical styles.

    <style>{` p { color: red; } `}</style>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<style>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

*   `children`: a string, required. The contents of the stylesheet.
*   `precedence`: a string. Tells React where to rank the `<style>` DOM node relative to others in the document `<head>`, which determines which stylesheet can override the other. React will infer that precedence values it discovers first are “lower” and precedence values it discovers later are “higher”. Many style systems can work fine using a single precedence value because style rules are atomic. Stylesheets with the same precedence go together whether they are `<link>` or inline `<style>` tags or loaded using [`preinit`](/reference/react-dom/preinit) functions.
*   `href`: a string. Allows React to [de-duplicate styles](#special-rendering-behavior) that have the same `href`.
*   `media`: a string. Restricts the stylesheet to a certain [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries).
*   `nonce`: a string. A cryptographic [nonce to allow the resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) when using a strict Content Security Policy.
*   `title`: a string. Specifies the name of an [alternative stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets).

Props that are **not recommended** for use with React:

*   `blocking`: a string. If set to `"render"`, instructs the browser not to render the page until the stylesheet is loaded. React provides more fine-grained control using Suspense.

#### Special rendering behavior[](#special-rendering-behavior "Link for Special rendering behavior ")

React can move `<style>` components to the document’s `<head>`, de-duplicate identical stylesheets, and [suspend](/reference/react/Suspense) while the stylesheet is loading.

To opt into this behavior, provide the `href` and `precedence` props. React will de-duplicate styles if they have the same `href`. The precedence prop tells React where to rank the `<style>` DOM node relative to others in the document `<head>`, which determines which stylesheet can override the other.

This special treatment comes with two caveats:

*   React will ignore changes to props after the style has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)
*   React will drop all extraneous props when using the `precedence` prop (beyond `href` and `precedence`).
*   React may leave the style in the DOM even after the component that rendered it has been unmounted.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Rendering an inline CSS stylesheet[](#rendering-an-inline-css-stylesheet "Link for Rendering an inline CSS stylesheet ")

If a component depends on certain CSS styles in order to be displayed correctly, you can render an inline stylesheet within the component.

The `href` prop should uniquely identify the stylesheet, because React will de-duplicate stylesheets that have the same `href`. If you supply a `precedence` prop, React will reorder inline stylesheets based on the order these values appear in the component tree.

Inline stylesheets will not trigger Suspense boundaries while they’re loading. Even if they load async resources like fonts or images.

### `<title>`[](#title "Link for this heading")

To specify the title of the document, render the [built-in browser `<title>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title). You can render `<title>` from any component and React will always place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.

    <title>My Blog</title>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props ")

`<title>` supports all [common element props.](/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

*   `children`: `<title>` accepts only text as a child. This text will become the title of the document. You can also pass your own components as long as they only render text.

#### Special rendering behavior[](#special-rendering-behavior "Link for Special rendering behavior ")

React will always place the DOM element corresponding to the `<title>` component within the document’s `<head>`, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The `<head>` is the only valid place for `<title>` to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render its `<title>` itself.

There are two exception to this:

*   If `<title>` is within an `<svg>` component, then there is no special behavior, because in this context it doesn’t represent the document’s title but rather is an [accessibility annotation for that SVG graphic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title).
*   If the `<title>` has an [`itemProp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop) prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t represent the document’s title but rather metadata about a specific part of the page.

### Pitfall

Only render a single `<title>` at a time. If more than one component renders a `<title>` tag at the same time, React will place all of those titles in the document head. When this happens, the behavior of browsers and search engines is undefined.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Set the document title[](#set-the-document-title "Link for Set the document title ")

Render the `<title>` component from any component with text as its children. React will put a `<title>` DOM node in the document `<head>`.

}

### Use variables in the title[](#use-variables-in-the-title "Link for Use variables in the title ")

The children of the `<title>` component must be a single string of text. (Or a single number or a single object with a `toString` method.) It might not be obvious, but using JSX curly braces like this:

    <title>Results page {pageNumber}</title> // 🔴 Problem: This is not a single string

… actually causes the `<title>` component to get a two-element array as its children (the string `"Results page"` and the value of `pageNumber`). This will cause an error. Instead, use string interpolation to pass `<title>` a single string:

    <title>{`Results page ${pageNumber}`}</title>

React DOM APIs[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
====================================================

The `react-dom` package contains methods that are only supported for the web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). They are not supported for React Native.

* * *

APIs[](#apis "Link for APIs ")
------------------------------

These APIs can be imported from your components. They are rarely used:

*   [`createPortal`](/reference/react-dom/createPortal) lets you render child components in a different part of the DOM tree.
*   [`flushSync`](/reference/react-dom/flushSync) lets you force React to flush a state update and update the DOM synchronously.

Resource Preloading APIs[](#resource-preloading-apis "Link for Resource Preloading APIs ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These APIs can be used to make apps faster by pre-loading resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and fonts as soon as you know you need them, for example before navigating to another page where the resources will be used.

[React-based frameworks](/learn/start-a-new-react-project) frequently handle resource loading for you, so you might not have to call these APIs yourself. Consult your framework’s documentation for details.

*   [`prefetchDNS`](/reference/react-dom/prefetchDNS) lets you prefetch the IP address of a DNS domain name that you expect to connect to.
*   [`preconnect`](/reference/react-dom/preconnect) lets you connect to a server you expect to request resources from, even if you don’t know what resources you’ll need yet.
*   [`preload`](/reference/react-dom/preload) lets you fetch a stylesheet, font, image, or external script that you expect to use.
*   [`preloadModule`](/reference/react-dom/preloadModule) lets you fetch an ESM module that you expect to use.
*   [`preinit`](/reference/react-dom/preinit) lets you fetch and evaluate an external script or fetch and insert a stylesheet.
*   [`preinitModule`](/reference/react-dom/preinitModule) lets you fetch and evaluate an ESM module.

* * *

Entry points[](#entry-points "Link for Entry points ")
------------------------------------------------------

The `react-dom` package provides two additional entry points:

*   [`react-dom/client`](/reference/react-dom/client) contains APIs to render React components on the client (in the browser).
*   [`react-dom/server`](/reference/react-dom/server) contains APIs to render React components on the server.

* * *

Removed APIs[](#removed-apis "Link for Removed APIs ")
------------------------------------------------------

These APIs were removed in React 19:

*   [`findDOMNode`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/findDOMNode): see [alternatives](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/findDOMNode#alternatives).
*   [`hydrate`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate): use [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) instead.
*   [`render`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/render): use [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot) instead.
*   [`unmountComponentAtNode`](/reference/react-dom/unmountComponentAtNode): use [`root.unmount()`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#root-unmount) instead.
*   [`renderToNodeStream`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToNodeStream): use [`react-dom/server`](/reference/react-dom/server) APIs instead.
*   [`renderToStaticNodeStream`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream): use [`react-dom/server`](/reference/react-dom/server) APIs instead.

---------------------------------------------

### `createPortal(children, domNode, key?)`[](#createportal "Link for this heading")

To create a portal, call `createPortal`, passing some JSX, and the DOM node where it should be rendered:

    import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';// ...<div>  <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>  {createPortal(    <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,    document.body  )}</div>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

A portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `children`: Anything that can be rendered with React, such as a piece of JSX (e.g. `<div />` or `<SomeComponent />`), a [Fragment](/reference/react/Fragment) (`<>...</>`), a string or a number, or an array of these.
    
*   `domNode`: Some DOM node, such as those returned by `document.getElementById()`. The node must already exist. Passing a different DOM node during an update will cause the portal content to be recreated.
    
*   **optional** `key`: A unique string or number to be used as the portal’s [key.](/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key)
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`createPortal` returns a React node that can be included into JSX or returned from a React component. If React encounters it in the render output, it will place the provided `children` inside the provided `domNode`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Events from portals propagate according to the React tree rather than the DOM tree. For example, if you click inside a portal, and the portal is wrapped in `<div onClick>`, that `onClick` handler will fire. If this causes issues, either stop the event propagation from inside the portal, or move the portal itself up in the React tree.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Rendering to a different part of the DOM[](#rendering-to-a-different-part-of-the-dom "Link for Rendering to a different part of the DOM ")

_Portals_ let your components render some of their children into a different place in the DOM. This lets a part of your component “escape” from whatever containers it may be in. For example, a component can display a modal dialog or a tooltip that appears above and outside of the rest of the page.

To create a portal, render the result of `createPortal` with some JSX and the DOM node where it should go:

    import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';function MyComponent() {  return (    <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>      <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>      {createPortal(        <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,        document.body      )}    </div>  );}

React will put the DOM nodes for the JSX you passed inside of the DOM node you provided.

Without a portal, the second `<p>` would be placed inside the parent `<div>`, but the portal “teleported” it into the [`document.body`:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/body)

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div style\={{ border: '2px solid black' }}\>
      <p\>This child is placed in the parent div.</p\>
      {createPortal(
        <p\>This child is placed in the document body.</p\>,
        document.body
      )}
    </div\>
  );
}

Notice how the second paragraph visually appears outside the parent `<div>` with the border. If you inspect the DOM structure with developer tools, you’ll see that the second `<p>` got placed directly into the `<body>`:

    <body>  <div id="root">    ...      <div style="border: 2px solid black">        <p>This child is placed inside the parent div.</p>      </div>    ...  </div>  <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p></body>

A portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events still bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.

* * *

### Rendering a modal dialog with a portal[](#rendering-a-modal-dialog-with-a-portal "Link for Rendering a modal dialog with a portal ")

You can use a portal to create a modal dialog that floats above the rest of the page, even if the component that summons the dialog is inside a container with `overflow: hidden` or other styles that interfere with the dialog.

In this example, the two containers have styles that disrupt the modal dialog, but the one rendered into a portal is unaffected because, in the DOM, the modal is not contained within the parent JSX elements.

App.jsNoPortalExample.jsPortalExample.jsModalContent.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import NoPortalExample from './NoPortalExample';
import PortalExample from './PortalExample';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <\>
      <div className\="clipping-container"\>
        <NoPortalExample  />
      </div\>
      <div className\="clipping-container"\>
        <PortalExample />
      </div\>
    </\>
  );
}

### Pitfall

It’s important to make sure that your app is accessible when using portals. For instance, you may need to manage keyboard focus so that the user can move the focus in and out of the portal in a natural way.

Follow the [WAI-ARIA Modal Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/#dialog_modal) when creating modals. If you use a community package, ensure that it is accessible and follows these guidelines.

### Rendering React components into non-React server markup[](#rendering-react-components-into-non-react-server-markup "Link for Rendering React components into non-React server markup ")

Portals can be useful if your React root is only part of a static or server-rendered page that isn’t built with React. For example, if your page is built with a server framework like Rails, you can create areas of interactivity within static areas such as sidebars. Compared with having [multiple separate React roots,](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#rendering-a-page-partially-built-with-react) portals let you treat the app as a single React tree with shared state even though its parts render to different parts of the DOM.

### Rendering React components into non-React DOM nodes[](#rendering-react-components-into-non-react-dom-nodes "Link for Rendering React components into non-React DOM nodes ")

You can also use a portal to manage the content of a DOM node that’s managed outside of React. For example, suppose you’re integrating with a non-React map widget and you want to render React content inside a popup. To do this, declare a `popupContainer` state variable to store the DOM node you’re going to render into:

    const [popupContainer, setPopupContainer] = useState(null);

When you create the third-party widget, store the DOM node returned by the widget so you can render into it:

    useEffect(() => {  if (mapRef.current === null) {    const map = createMapWidget(containerRef.current);    mapRef.current = map;    const popupDiv = addPopupToMapWidget(map);    setPopupContainer(popupDiv);  }}, []);

This lets you use `createPortal` to render React content into `popupContainer` once it becomes available:

    return (  <div style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }} ref={containerRef}>    {popupContainer !== null && createPortal(      <p>Hello from React!</p>,      popupContainer    )}  </div>);

Here is a complete example you can play with:

App.jsmap-widget.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createMapWidget, addPopupToMapWidget } from './map-widget.js';

export default function Map() {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  const mapRef = useRef(null);
  const \[popupContainer, setPopupContainer\] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() \=> {
    if (mapRef.current === null) {
      const map = createMapWidget(containerRef.current);
      mapRef.current = map;
      const popupDiv = addPopupToMapWidget(map);
      setPopupContainer(popupDiv);
    }
  }, \[\]);

  return (
    <div style\={{ width: 250, height: 250 }} ref\={containerRef}\>
      {popupContainer !== null && createPortal(
        <p\>Hello from React!</p\>,
        popupContainer
      )}

flushSync[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===============================================

### Pitfall

Using `flushSync` is uncommon and can hurt the performance of your app.

`flushSync` lets you force React to flush any updates inside the provided callback synchronously. This ensures that the DOM is updated immediately.

    flushSync(callback)

*   [Reference](#reference)
    *   [`flushSync(callback)`](#flushsync)
*   [Usage](#usage)
    *   [Flushing updates for third-party integrations](#flushing-updates-for-third-party-integrations)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `flushSync(callback)`[](#flushsync "Link for this heading")

Call `flushSync` to force React to flush any pending work and update the DOM synchronously.

    import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';flushSync(() => {  setSomething(123);});

Most of the time, `flushSync` can be avoided. Use `flushSync` as last resort.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `callback`: A function. React will immediately call this callback and flush any updates it contains synchronously. It may also flush any pending updates, or Effects, or updates inside of Effects. If an update suspends as a result of this `flushSync` call, the fallbacks may be re-shown.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`flushSync` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `flushSync` can significantly hurt performance. Use sparingly.
*   `flushSync` may force pending Suspense boundaries to show their `fallback` state.
*   `flushSync` may run pending Effects and synchronously apply any updates they contain before returning.
*   `flushSync` may flush updates outside the callback when necessary to flush the updates inside the callback. For example, if there are pending updates from a click, React may flush those before flushing the updates inside the callback.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Flushing updates for third-party integrations[](#flushing-updates-for-third-party-integrations "Link for Flushing updates for third-party integrations ")

When integrating with third-party code such as browser APIs or UI libraries, it may be necessary to force React to flush updates. Use `flushSync` to force React to flush any state updates inside the callback synchronously:

    flushSync(() => {  setSomething(123);});// By this line, the DOM is updated.

This ensures that, by the time the next line of code runs, React has already updated the DOM.

**Using `flushSync` is uncommon, and using it often can significantly hurt the performance of your app.** If your app only uses React APIs, and does not integrate with third-party libraries, `flushSync` should be unnecessary.

However, it can be helpful for integrating with third-party code like browser APIs.

Some browser APIs expect results inside of callbacks to be written to the DOM synchronously, by the end of the callback, so the browser can do something with the rendered DOM. In most cases, React handles this for you automatically. But in some cases it may be necessary to force a synchronous update.

For example, the browser `onbeforeprint` API allows you to change the page immediately before the print dialog opens. This is useful for applying custom print styles that allow the document to display better for printing. In the example below, you use `flushSync` inside of the `onbeforeprint` callback to immediately “flush” the React state to the DOM. Then, by the time the print dialog opens, `isPrinting` displays “yes”:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';

export default function PrintApp() {
  const \[isPrinting, setIsPrinting\] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() \=> {
    function handleBeforePrint() {
      flushSync(() \=> {
        setIsPrinting(true);
      })
    }

    function handleAfterPrint() {
      setIsPrinting(false);
    }

    window.addEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint);
    window.addEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint);
    return () \=> {
      window.removeEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint);
      window.removeEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint);
    }
  }, \[\]);

  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>isPrinting: {isPrinting ? 'yes' : 'no'}</h1\>
      <button onClick\={() \=> window.print()}\>
        Print
      </button\>
    </\>
  );
}

Show more

Without `flushSync`, the print dialog will display `isPrinting` as “no”. This is because React batches the updates asynchronously and the print dialog is displayed before the state is updated.

### Pitfall

`flushSync` can significantly hurt performance, and may unexpectedly force pending Suspense boundaries to show their fallback state.

Most of the time, `flushSync` can be avoided, so use `flushSync` as a last resort.

*   `options`: an object. It contains the following properties:
    *   `as`: a required string. The type of resource. Its possible values are `script` and `style`.
    *   `precedence`: a string. Required with stylesheets. Says where to insert the stylesheet relative to others. Stylesheets with higher precedence can override those with lower precedence. The possible values are `reset`, `low`, `medium`, `high`.
    *   `crossOrigin`: a string. The [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) to use. Its possible values are `anonymous` and `use-credentials`.
    *   `integrity`: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to [verify its authenticity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`preinitModule` returns nothing.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   In the browser, you can call `preinitModule` in any situation: while rendering a component, in an Effect, in an event handler, and so on.
*   In server-side rendering or when rendering Server Components, `preinitModule` only has an effect if you call it while rendering a component or in an async context originating from rendering a component. Any other calls will be ignored.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Preloading when rendering[](#preloading-when-rendering "Link for Preloading when rendering ")

Call `preinitModule` when rendering a component if you know that it or its children will use a specific module and you’re OK with the module being evaluated and thereby taking effect immediately upon being downloaded.

    import { preinitModule } from 'react-dom';function AppRoot() {  preinitModule("https://example.com/module.js", {as: "script"});  return ...;}

If you want the browser to download the module but not to execute it right away, use [`preloadModule`](/reference/react-dom/preloadModule) instead. If you want to preinit a script that isn’t an ESM module, use [`preinit`](/reference/react-dom/preinit).

### Preloading in an event handler[](#preloading-in-an-event-handler "Link for Preloading in an event handler ")

Call `preinitModule` in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where the module will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.

    import { preinitModule } from 'react-dom';function CallToAction() {  const onClick = () => {    preinitModule("https://example.com/module.js", {as: "script"});    startWizard();  }  return (    <button onClick={onClick}>Start Wizard</button>  );}

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `preload(href, options)`[](#preload "Link for this heading")

To preload a resource, call the `preload` function from `react-dom`.

    import { preload } from 'react-dom';function AppRoot() {  preload("https://example.com/font.woff2", {as: "font"});  // ...}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

The `preload` function provides the browser with a hint that it should start downloading the given resource, which can save time.

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `href`: a string. The URL of the resource you want to download.
*   `options`: an object. It contains the following properties:
    *   `as`: a required string. The type of resource. Its [possible values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#as) are `audio`, `document`, `embed`, `fetch`, `font`, `image`, `object`, `script`, `style`, `track`, `video`, `worker`.
    *   `crossOrigin`: a string. The [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) to use. Its possible values are `anonymous` and `use-credentials`. It is required when `as` is set to `"fetch"`.
    *   `referrerPolicy`: a string. The [Referrer header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#referrerpolicy) to send when fetching. Its possible values are `no-referrer-when-downgrade` (the default), `no-referrer`, `origin`, `origin-when-cross-origin`, and `unsafe-url`.
    *   `integrity`: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to [verify its authenticity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
    *   `type`: a string. The MIME type of the resource.
    *   `nonce`: a string. A cryptographic [nonce to allow the resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) when using a strict Content Security Policy.
    *   `fetchPriority`: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are `auto` (the default), `high`, and `low`.
    *   `imageSrcSet`: a string. For use only with `as: "image"`. Specifies the [source set of the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).
    *   `imageSizes`: a string. For use only with `as: "image"`. Specifies the [sizes of the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`preload` returns nothing.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Multiple equivalent calls to `preload` have the same effect as a single call. Calls to `preload` are considered equivalent according to the following rules:
    *   Two calls are equivalent if they have the same `href`, except:
    *   If `as` is set to `image`, two calls are equivalent if they have the same `href`, `imageSrcSet`, and `imageSizes`.
*   In the browser, you can call `preload` in any situation: while rendering a component, in an Effect, in an event handler, and so on.
*   In server-side rendering or when rendering Server Components, `preload` only has an effect if you call it while rendering a component or in an async context originating from rendering a component. Any other calls will be ignored.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Preloading when rendering[](#preloading-when-rendering "Link for Preloading when rendering ")

Call `preload` when rendering a component if you know that it or its children will use a specific resource.

#### Examples of preloading[](#examples "Link for Examples of preloading")

1. Preloading an external script 2. Preloading a stylesheet 3. Preloading a font 4. Preloading an image

#### 

Example 1 of 4:

Preloading an external script[](#preloading-an-external-script "Link for this heading")

    import { preload } from 'react-dom';function AppRoot() {  preload("https://example.com/script.js", {as: "script"});  return ...;}

If you want the browser to start executing the script immediately (rather than just downloading it), use [`preinit`](/reference/react-dom/preinit) instead. If you want to load an ESM module, use [`preloadModule`](/reference/react-dom/preloadModule).

Next Example

### Preloading in an event handler[](#preloading-in-an-event-handler "Link for Preloading in an event handler ")

Call `preload` in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.

Client React DOM APIs[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===========================================================

The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser). These APIs are typically used at the top level of your app to initialize your React tree. A [framework](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks) may call them for you. Most of your components don’t need to import or use them.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `createRoot(domNode, options?)`[](#createroot "Link for this heading")

Call `createRoot` to create a React root for displaying content inside a browser DOM element.

    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';const domNode = document.getElementById('root');const root = createRoot(domNode);

React will create a root for the `domNode`, and take over managing the DOM inside it. After you’ve created a root, you need to call [`root.render`](#root-render) to display a React component inside of it:

    root.render(<App />);

An app fully built with React will usually only have one `createRoot` call for its root component. A page that uses “sprinkles” of React for parts of the page may have as many separate roots as needed.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `domNode`: A [DOM element.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) React will create a root for this DOM element and allow you to call functions on the root, such as `render` to display rendered React content.
    
*   **optional** `options`: An object with options for this React root.
    
    *   **optional** `onCaughtError`: Callback called when React catches an error in an Error Boundary. Called with the `error` caught by the Error Boundary, and an `errorInfo` object containing the `componentStack`.
    *   **optional** `onUncaughtError`: Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an Error Boundary. Called with the `error` that was thrown, and an `errorInfo` object containing the `componentStack`.
    *   **optional** `onRecoverableError`: Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors. Called with an `error` React throws, and an `errorInfo` object containing the `componentStack`. Some recoverable errors may include the original error cause as `error.cause`.
    *   **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`createRoot` returns an object with two methods: [`render`](#root-render) and [`unmount`.](#root-unmount)

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   If your app is server-rendered, using `createRoot()` is not supported. Use [`hydrateRoot()`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) instead.
*   You’ll likely have only one `createRoot` call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.
*   When you want to render a piece of JSX in a different part of the DOM tree that isn’t a child of your component (for example, a modal or a tooltip), use [`createPortal`](/reference/react-dom/createPortal) instead of `createRoot`.

* * *

### `root.render(reactNode)`[](#root-render "Link for this heading")

Call `root.render` to display a piece of [JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) (“React node”) into the React root’s browser DOM node.

    root.render(<App />);

React will display `<App />` in the `root`, and take over managing the DOM inside it.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#root-render-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `reactNode`: A _React node_ that you want to display. This will usually be a piece of JSX like `<App />`, but you can also pass a React element constructed with [`createElement()`](/reference/react/createElement), a string, a number, `null`, or `undefined`.

#### Returns[](#root-render-returns "Link for Returns ")

`root.render` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#root-render-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   The first time you call `root.render`, React will clear all the existing HTML content inside the React root before rendering the React component into it.
    
*   If your root’s DOM node contains HTML generated by React on the server or during the build, use [`hydrateRoot()`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) instead, which attaches the event handlers to the existing HTML.
    
*   If you call `render` on the same root more than once, React will update the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest JSX you passed. React will decide which parts of the DOM can be reused and which need to be recreated by [“matching it up”](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) with the previously rendered tree. Calling `render` on the same root again is similar to calling the [`set` function](/reference/react/useState#setstate) on the root component: React avoids unnecessary DOM updates.
    
*   Although rendering is synchronous once it starts, `root.render(...)` is not. This means code after `root.render()` may run before any effects (`useLayoutEffect`, `useEffect`) of that specific render are fired. This is usually fine and rarely needs adjustment. In rare cases where effect timing matters, you can wrap `root.render(...)` in [`flushSync`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/flushSync) to ensure the initial render runs fully synchronously.
    
        const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(<App />);// 🚩 The HTML will not include the rendered <App /> yet:console.log(document.body.innerHTML);
    

* * *

### `root.unmount()`[](#root-unmount "Link for this heading")

Call `root.unmount` to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.

    root.unmount();

An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to `root.unmount`.

This is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. In that case, you need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling `root.unmount`. Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t know to clean up and free up global resources like subscriptions.

Calling `root.unmount` will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree.

#### Parameters[](#root-unmount-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`root.unmount` does not accept any parameters.

#### Returns[](#root-unmount-returns "Link for Returns ")

`root.unmount` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#root-unmount-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Calling `root.unmount` will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.
    
*   Once you call `root.unmount` you cannot call `root.render` again on the same root. Attempting to call `root.render` on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error. However, you can create a new root for the same DOM node after the previous root for that node has been unmounted.
    

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Rendering an app fully built with React[](#rendering-an-app-fully-built-with-react "Link for Rendering an app fully built with React ")

If your app is fully built with React, create a single root for your entire app.

    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(<App />);

Usually, you only need to run this code once at startup. It will:

1.  Find the browser DOM node defined in your HTML.
2.  Display the React component for your app inside.

index.jsindex.htmlApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.js';
import './styles.css';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);

**If your app is fully built with React, you shouldn’t need to create any more roots, or to call [`root.render`](#root-render) again.**

From this point on, React will manage the DOM of your entire app. To add more components, [nest them inside the `App` component.](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components) When you need to update the UI, each of your components can do this by [using state.](/reference/react/useState) When you need to display extra content like a modal or a tooltip outside the DOM node, [render it with a portal.](/reference/react-dom/createPortal)

### Note

When your HTML is empty, the user sees a blank page until the app’s JavaScript code loads and runs:

    <div id="root"></div>

This can feel very slow! To solve this, you can generate the initial HTML from your components [on the server or during the build.](/reference/react-dom/server) Then your visitors can read text, see images, and click links before any of the JavaScript code loads. We recommend [using a framework](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks) that does this optimization out of the box. Depending on when it runs, this is called _server-side rendering (SSR)_ or _static site generation (SSG)._

### Pitfall

**Apps using server rendering or static generation must call [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) instead of `createRoot`.** React will then _hydrate_ (reuse) the DOM nodes from your HTML instead of destroying and re-creating them.

* * *

### Rendering a page partially built with React[](#rendering-a-page-partially-built-with-react "Link for Rendering a page partially built with React ")

If your page [isn’t fully built with React](/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project#using-react-for-a-part-of-your-existing-page), you can call `createRoot` multiple times to create a root for each top-level piece of UI managed by React. You can display different content in each root by calling [`root.render`.](#root-render)

Here, two different React components are rendered into two DOM nodes defined in the `index.html` file:

index.jsindex.htmlComponents.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import './styles.css';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { Comments, Navigation } from './Components.js';

const navDomNode = document.getElementById('navigation');
const navRoot = createRoot(navDomNode); 
navRoot.render(<Navigation />);

const commentDomNode = document.getElementById('comments');
const commentRoot = createRoot(commentDomNode); 
commentRoot.render(<Comments />);

You could also create a new DOM node with [`document.createElement()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) and add it to the document manually.

    const domNode = document.createElement('div');const root = createRoot(domNode); root.render(<Comment />);document.body.appendChild(domNode); // You can add it anywhere in the document

To remove the React tree from the DOM node and clean up all the resources used by it, call [`root.unmount`.](#root-unmount)

    root.unmount();

This is mostly useful if your React components are inside an app written in a different framework.

* * *

### Updating a root component[](#updating-a-root-component "Link for Updating a root component ")

You can call `render` more than once on the same root. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will [preserve the state.](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated `render` calls every second in this example are not destructive:

index.jsApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './styles.css';
import App from './App.js';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

let i = 0;
setInterval(() \=> {
  root.render(<App counter\={i} />);
  i++;
}, 1000);

It is uncommon to call `render` multiple times. Usually, your components will [update state](/reference/react/useState) instead.

### Error logging in production[](#error-logging-in-production "Link for Error logging in production ")

By default, React will log all errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional error handler root options `onUncaughtError`, `onCaughtError` and `onRecoverableError`:

    import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";import { reportCaughtError } from "./reportError";const container = document.getElementById("root");const root = createRoot(container, {  onCaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {    if (error.message !== "Known error") {      reportCaughtError({        error,        componentStack: errorInfo.componentStack,      });    }  },});

The onCaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:

1.  The error that was thrown.
2.  An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.

Together with `onUncaughtError` and `onRecoverableError`, you can can implement your own error reporting system:

index.jsreportError.jsApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.js";
import {
  onCaughtErrorProd,
  onRecoverableErrorProd,
  onUncaughtErrorProd,
} from "./reportError";

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(container, {
  // Keep in mind to remove these options in development to leverage
  // React's default handlers or implement your own overlay for development.
  // The handlers are only specfied unconditionally here for demonstration purposes.
  onCaughtError: onCaughtErrorProd,
  onRecoverableError: onRecoverableErrorProd,
  onUncaughtError: onUncaughtErrorProd,
});
root.render(<App />);

### I’ve created a root, but nothing is displayed[](#ive-created-a-root-but-nothing-is-displayed "Link for I’ve created a root, but nothing is displayed ")

Make sure you haven’t forgotten to actually _render_ your app into the root:

    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(<App />);

Until you do that, nothing is displayed.

* * *

### I’m getting an error: “You passed a second argument to root.render”[](#im-getting-an-error-you-passed-a-second-argument-to-root-render "Link for I’m getting an error: “You passed a second argument to root.render” ")

A common mistake is to pass the options for `createRoot` to `root.render(...)`:

Console

Warning: You passed a second argument to root.render(…) but it only accepts one argument.

To fix, pass the root options to `createRoot(...)`, not `root.render(...)`:

    // 🚩 Wrong: root.render only takes one argument.root.render(App, {onUncaughtError});// ✅ Correct: pass options to createRoot.const root = createRoot(container, {onUncaughtError}); root.render(<App />);

* * *

### I’m getting an error: “Target container is not a DOM element”[](#im-getting-an-error-target-container-is-not-a-dom-element "Link for I’m getting an error: “Target container is not a DOM element” ")

This error means that whatever you’re passing to `createRoot` is not a DOM node.

If you’re not sure what’s happening, try logging it:

    const domNode = document.getElementById('root');console.log(domNode); // ???const root = createRoot(domNode);root.render(<App />);

For example, if `domNode` is `null`, it means that [`getElementById`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) returned `null`. This will happen if there is no node in the document with the given ID at the time of your call. There may be a few reasons for it:

1.  The ID you’re looking for might differ from the ID you used in the HTML file. Check for typos!
2.  Your bundle’s `<script>` tag cannot “see” any DOM nodes that appear _after_ it in the HTML.

Another common way to get this error is to write `createRoot(<App />)` instead of `createRoot(domNode)`.

* * *

### I’m getting an error: “Functions are not valid as a React child.”[](#im-getting-an-error-functions-are-not-valid-as-a-react-child "Link for I’m getting an error: “Functions are not valid as a React child.” ")

This error means that whatever you’re passing to `root.render` is not a React component.

This may happen if you call `root.render` with `Component` instead of `<Component />`:

    // 🚩 Wrong: App is a function, not a Component.root.render(App);// ✅ Correct: <App /> is a component.root.render(<App />);

Or if you pass a function to `root.render`, instead of the result of calling it:

    // 🚩 Wrong: createApp is a function, not a component.root.render(createApp);// ✅ Correct: call createApp to return a component.root.render(createApp());

* * *

### My server-rendered HTML gets re-created from scratch[](#my-server-rendered-html-gets-re-created-from-scratch "Link for My server-rendered HTML gets re-created from scratch ")

If your app is server-rendered and includes the initial HTML generated by React, you might notice that creating a root and calling `root.render` deletes all that HTML, and then re-creates all the DOM nodes from scratch. This can be slower, resets focus and scroll positions, and may lose other user input.

Server-rendered apps must use [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) instead of `createRoot`:

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(  document.getElementById('root'),  <App />);

Note that its API is different. In particular, usually there will be no further `root.render` call.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `hydrateRoot(domNode, reactNode, options?)`[](#hydrateroot "Link for this heading")

Call `hydrateRoot` to “attach” React to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment.

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';const domNode = document.getElementById('root');const root = hydrateRoot(domNode, reactNode);

React will attach to the HTML that exists inside the `domNode`, and take over managing the DOM inside it. An app fully built with React will usually only have one `hydrateRoot` call with its root component.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `domNode`: A [DOM element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) that was rendered as the root element on the server.
    
*   `reactNode`: The “React node” used to render the existing HTML. This will usually be a piece of JSX like `<App />` which was rendered with a `ReactDOM Server` method such as `renderToPipeableStream(<App />)`.
    
*   **optional** `options`: An object with options for this React root.
    
    *   **optional** `onCaughtError`: Callback called when React catches an error in an Error Boundary. Called with the `error` caught by the Error Boundary, and an `errorInfo` object containing the `componentStack`.
    *   **optional** `onUncaughtError`: Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an Error Boundary. Called with the `error` that was thrown and an `errorInfo` object containing the `componentStack`.
    *   **optional** `onRecoverableError`: Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors. Called with the `error` React throws, and an `errorInfo` object containing the `componentStack`. Some recoverable errors may include the original error cause as `error.cause`.
    *   **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as used on the server.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`hydrateRoot` returns an object with two methods: [`render`](#root-render) and [`unmount`.](#root-unmount)

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `hydrateRoot()` expects the rendered content to be identical with the server-rendered content. You should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them.
*   In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.
*   You’ll likely have only one `hydrateRoot` call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.
*   If your app is client-rendered with no HTML rendered already, using `hydrateRoot()` is not supported. Use [`createRoot()`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot) instead.

* * *

### `root.render(reactNode)`[](#root-render "Link for this heading")

Call `root.render` to update a React component inside a hydrated React root for a browser DOM element.

    root.render(<App />);

React will update `<App />` in the hydrated `root`.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#root-render-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `reactNode`: A “React node” that you want to update. This will usually be a piece of JSX like `<App />`, but you can also pass a React element constructed with [`createElement()`](/reference/react/createElement), a string, a number, `null`, or `undefined`.

#### Returns[](#root-render-returns "Link for Returns ")

`root.render` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#root-render-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   If you call `root.render` before the root has finished hydrating, React will clear the existing server-rendered HTML content and switch the entire root to client rendering.

* * *

### `root.unmount()`[](#root-unmount "Link for this heading")

Call `root.unmount` to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.

    root.unmount();

An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to `root.unmount`.

This is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. You need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling `root.unmount`. Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t clean up and free up resources like subscriptions.

Calling `root.unmount` will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree.

#### Parameters[](#root-unmount-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`root.unmount` does not accept any parameters.

#### Returns[](#root-unmount-returns "Link for Returns ")

`root.unmount` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#root-unmount-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Calling `root.unmount` will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.
    
*   Once you call `root.unmount` you cannot call `root.render` again on the root. Attempting to call `root.render` on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error.
    

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Hydrating server-rendered HTML[](#hydrating-server-rendered-html "Link for Hydrating server-rendered HTML ")

If your app’s HTML was generated by [`react-dom/server`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot), you need to _hydrate_ it on the client.

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);

This will hydrate the server HTML inside the browser DOM node with the React component for your app. Usually, you will do it once at startup. If you use a framework, it might do this behind the scenes for you.

To hydrate your app, React will “attach” your components’ logic to the initial generated HTML from the server. Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot from the server into a fully interactive app that runs in the browser.

index.jsindex.htmlApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import './styles.css';
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.js';

hydrateRoot(
  document.getElementById('root'),
  <App />
);

You shouldn’t need to call `hydrateRoot` again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will [use state](/reference/react/useState) instead.

### Pitfall

The React tree you pass to `hydrateRoot` needs to produce **the same output** as it did on the server.

This is important for the user experience. The user will spend some time looking at the server-generated HTML before your JavaScript code loads. Server rendering creates an illusion that the app loads faster by showing the HTML snapshot of its output. Suddenly showing different content breaks that illusion. This is why the server render output must match the initial render output on the client.

The most common causes leading to hydration errors include:

*   Extra whitespace (like newlines) around the React-generated HTML inside the root node.
*   Using checks like `typeof window !== 'undefined'` in your rendering logic.
*   Using browser-only APIs like [`window.matchMedia`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) in your rendering logic.
*   Rendering different data on the server and the client.

React recovers from some hydration errors, but **you must fix them like other bugs.** In the best case, they’ll lead to a slowdown; in the worst case, event handlers can get attached to the wrong elements.

* * *

### Hydrating an entire document[](#hydrating-an-entire-document "Link for Hydrating an entire document ")

Apps fully built with React can render the entire document as JSX, including the [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html) tag:

    function App() {  return (    <html>      <head>        <meta charSet="utf-8" />        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"></link>        <title>My app</title>      </head>      <body>        <Router />      </body>    </html>  );}

To hydrate the entire document, pass the [`document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/document) global as the first argument to `hydrateRoot`:

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App />);

* * *

### Suppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors[](#suppressing-unavoidable-hydration-mismatch-errors "Link for Suppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors ")

If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning.

To silence hydration warnings on an element, add `suppressHydrationWarning={true}`:

index.jsindex.htmlApp.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function App() {
  return (
    <h1 suppressHydrationWarning\={true}\>
      Current Date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}
    </h1\>
  );
}

This only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. React will **not** attempt to patch mismatched text content.

* * *

### Handling different client and server content[](#handling-different-client-and-server-content "Link for Handling different client and server content ")

If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a [state variable](/reference/react/useState) like `isClient`, which you can set to `true` in an [Effect](/reference/react/useEffect):

index.jsindex.htmlApp.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const \[isClient, setIsClient\] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() \=> {
    setIsClient(true);
  }, \[\]);

  return (
    <h1\>
      {isClient ? 'Is Client' : 'Is Server'}
    </h1\>
  );
}

This way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.

### Pitfall

This approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may also feel jarring to the user.

* * *

### Updating a hydrated root component[](#updating-a-hydrated-root-component "Link for Updating a hydrated root component ")

After the root has finished hydrating, you can call [`root.render`](#root-render) to update the root React component. **Unlike with [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot), you don’t usually need to do this because the initial content was already rendered as HTML.**

If you call `root.render` at some point after hydration, and the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will [preserve the state.](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated `render` calls every second in this example are not destructive:

index.jsindex.htmlApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './styles.css';
import App from './App.js';

const root = hydrateRoot(
  document.getElementById('root'),
  <App counter\={0} />
);

let i = 0;
setInterval(() \=> {
  root.render(<App counter\={i} />);
  i++;
}, 1000);

It is uncommon to call [`root.render`](#root-render) on a hydrated root. Usually, you’ll [update state](/reference/react/useState) inside one of the components instead.

### Error logging in production[](#error-logging-in-production "Link for Error logging in production ")

By default, React will log all errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional error handler root options `onUncaughtError`, `onCaughtError` and `onRecoverableError`:

    import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";import App from "./App.js";import { reportCaughtError } from "./reportError";const container = document.getElementById("root");const root = hydrateRoot(container, <App />, {  onCaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {    if (error.message !== "Known error") {      reportCaughtError({        error,        componentStack: errorInfo.componentStack,      });    }  },});

The onCaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:

1.  The error that was thrown.
2.  An errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.

Together with `onUncaughtError` and `onRecoverableError`, you can implement your own error reporting system:

index.jsreportError.jsApp.js

index.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.js";
import {
  onCaughtErrorProd,
  onRecoverableErrorProd,
  onUncaughtErrorProd,
} from "./reportError";

const container = document.getElementById("root");
hydrateRoot(container, <App />, {
  // Keep in mind to remove these options in development to leverage
  // React's default handlers or implement your own overlay for development.
  // The handlers are only specfied unconditionally here for demonstration purposes.
  onCaughtError: onCaughtErrorProd,
  onRecoverableError: onRecoverableErrorProd,
  onUncaughtError: onUncaughtErrorProd,
});

A common mistake is to pass the options for `hydrateRoot` to `root.render(...)`:

Console

Warning: You passed a second argument to root.render(…) but it only accepts one argument.

To fix, pass the root options to `hydrateRoot(...)`, not `root.render(...)`:

### `renderToPipeableStream(reactNode, options?)`[](#rendertopipeablestream "Link for this heading")

Call `renderToPipeableStream` to render your React tree as HTML into a [Node.js Stream.](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#writable-streams)

    import { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server';const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    pipe(response);  }});

On the client, call [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) to make the server-generated HTML interactive.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `reactNode`: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like `<App />`. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the `App` component should render the `<html>` tag.
    
*   **optional** `options`: An object with streaming options.
    
    *   **optional** `bootstrapScriptContent`: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline `<script>` tag.
    *   **optional** `bootstrapScripts`: An array of string URLs for the `<script>` tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the `<script>` that calls [`hydrateRoot`.](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.
    *   **optional** `bootstrapModules`: Like `bootstrapScripts`, but emits [`<script type="module">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) instead.
    *   **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to [`hydrateRoot`.](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#parameters)
    *   **optional** `namespaceURI`: A string with the root [namespace URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElementNS#important_namespace_uris) for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass `'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'` for SVG or `'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'` for MathML.
    *   **optional** `nonce`: A [`nonce`](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#nonce) string to allow scripts for [`script-src` Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src).
    *   **optional** `onAllReady`: A callback that fires when all rendering is complete, including both the [shell](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell) and all additional [content.](#streaming-more-content-as-it-loads) You can use this instead of `onShellReady` [for crawlers and static generation.](#waiting-for-all-content-to-load-for-crawlers-and-static-generation) If you start streaming here, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML.
    *   **optional** `onError`: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether [recoverable](#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell) or [not.](#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell) By default, this only calls `console.error`. If you override it to [log crash reports,](#logging-crashes-on-the-server) make sure that you still call `console.error`. You can also use it to [adjust the status code](#setting-the-status-code) before the shell is emitted.
    *   **optional** `onShellReady`: A callback that fires right after the [initial shell](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell) has been rendered. You can [set the status code](#setting-the-status-code) and call `pipe` here to start streaming. React will [stream the additional content](#streaming-more-content-as-it-loads) after the shell along with the inline `<script>` tags that replace the HTML loading fallbacks with the content.
    *   **optional** `onShellError`: A callback that fires if there was an error rendering the initial shell. It receives the error as an argument. No bytes were emitted from the stream yet, and neither `onShellReady` nor `onAllReady` will get called, so you can [output a fallback HTML shell.](#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell)
    *   **optional** `progressiveChunkSize`: The number of bytes in a chunk. [Read more about the default heuristic.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/14c2be8dac2d5482fda8a0906a31d239df8551fc/packages/react-server/src/ReactFizzServer.js#L210-L225)

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`renderToPipeableStream` returns an object with two methods:

*   `pipe` outputs the HTML into the provided [Writable Node.js Stream.](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#writable-streams) Call `pipe` in `onShellReady` if you want to enable streaming, or in `onAllReady` for crawlers and static generation.
*   `abort` lets you [abort server rendering](#aborting-server-rendering) and render the rest on the client.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Rendering a React tree as HTML to a Node.js Stream[](#rendering-a-react-tree-as-html-to-a-nodejs-stream "Link for Rendering a React tree as HTML to a Node.js Stream ")

Call `renderToPipeableStream` to render your React tree as HTML into a [Node.js Stream:](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#writable-streams)

    import { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server';// The route handler syntax depends on your backend frameworkapp.use('/', (request, response) => {  const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],    onShellReady() {      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');      pipe(response);    }  });});

Along with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap `<script>` paths. Your root component should return **the entire document including the root `<html>` tag.**

For example, it might look like this:

    export default function App() {  return (    <html>      <head>        <meta charSet="utf-8" />        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"></link>        <title>My app</title>      </head>      <body>        <Router />      </body>    </html>  );}

React will inject the [doctype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype) and your bootstrap `<script>` tags into the resulting HTML stream:

    <!DOCTYPE html><html>  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... --></html><script src="/main.js" async=""></script>

On the client, your bootstrap script should [hydrate the entire `document` with a call to `hydrateRoot`:](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-an-entire-document)

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App />);

This will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.

##### Deep Dive

#### Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output[](#reading-css-and-js-asset-paths-from-the-build-output "Link for Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output ")

Show Details

The final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build. For example, instead of `styles.css` you might end up with `styles.123456.css`. Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content.

However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding `"/styles.css"` into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop:

    export default function App({ assetMap }) {  return (    <html>      <head>        ...        <link rel="stylesheet" href={assetMap['styles.css']}></link>        ...      </head>      ...    </html>  );}

On the server, render `<App assetMap={assetMap} />` and pass your `assetMap` with the asset URLs:

    // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = {  'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css',  'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};app.use('/', (request, response) => {  const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, {    bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['main.js']],    onShellReady() {      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');      pipe(response);    }  });});

Since your server is now rendering `<App assetMap={assetMap} />`, you need to render it with `assetMap` on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass `assetMap` to the client like this:

    // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = {  'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css',  'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};app.use('/', (request, response) => {  const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, {    // Careful: It's safe to stringify() this because this data isn't user-generated.    bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`,    bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['main.js']],    onShellReady() {      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');      pipe(response);    }  });});

In the example above, the `bootstrapScriptContent` option adds an extra inline `<script>` tag that sets the global `window.assetMap` variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same `assetMap`:

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />);

Both client and server render `App` with the same `assetMap` prop, so there are no hydration errors.

* * *

### Streaming more content as it loads[](#streaming-more-content-as-it-loads "Link for Streaming more content as it loads ")

Streaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Sidebar>        <Friends />        <Photos />      </Sidebar>      <Posts />    </ProfileLayout>  );}

Imagine that loading data for `<Posts />` takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, [wrap `Posts` in a `<Suspense>` boundary:](/reference/react/Suspense#displaying-a-fallback-while-content-is-loading)

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Sidebar>        <Friends />        <Photos />      </Sidebar>      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

This tells React to start streaming the HTML before `Posts` loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (`PostsGlimmer`) first, and then, when `Posts` finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline `<script>` tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the `PostsGlimmer`, later replaced by the `Posts`.

You can further [nest `<Suspense>` boundaries](/reference/react/Suspense#revealing-nested-content-as-it-loads) to create a more granular loading sequence:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>        <Sidebar>          <Friends />          <Photos />        </Sidebar>        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>          <Posts />        </Suspense>      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

In this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only `ProfileLayout` and `ProfileCover` must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any `<Suspense>` boundary. However, if `Sidebar`, `Friends`, or `Photos` need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the `BigSpinner` fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.

Streaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the `<script>` tags load.

[Read more about how streaming HTML works.](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37)

### Note

**Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component.** They include:

*   Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)
*   Lazy-loading component code with [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy)
*   Reading the value of a Promise with [`use`](/reference/react/use)

Suspense **does not** detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.

The exact way you would load data in the `Posts` component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.

Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.

* * *

### Specifying what goes into the shell[](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell "Link for Specifying what goes into the shell ")

The part of your app outside of any `<Suspense>` boundaries is called _the shell:_

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>        <Sidebar>          <Friends />          <Photos />        </Sidebar>        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>          <Posts />        </Suspense>      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

It determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:

    <ProfileLayout>  <ProfileCover />  <BigSpinner /></ProfileLayout>

If you wrap the whole app into a `<Suspense>` boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the `<Suspense>` boundaries so that the shell feels _minimal but complete_—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.

The `onShellReady` callback fires when the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then:

    const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    pipe(response);  }});

By the time `onShellReady` fires, components in nested `<Suspense>` boundaries might still be loading data.

* * *

### Logging crashes on the server[](#logging-crashes-on-the-server "Link for Logging crashes on the server ")

By default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:

    const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    pipe(response);  },  onError(error) {    console.error(error);    logServerCrashReport(error);  }});

If you provide a custom `onError` implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.

* * *

### Recovering from errors inside the shell[](#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell "Link for Recovering from errors inside the shell ")

In this example, the shell contains `ProfileLayout`, `ProfileCover`, and `PostsGlimmer`:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

If an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Override `onShellError` to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:

    const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    pipe(response);  },  onShellError(error) {    response.statusCode = 500;    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>');   },  onError(error) {    console.error(error);    logServerCrashReport(error);  }});

If there is an error while generating the shell, both `onError` and `onShellError` will fire. Use `onError` for error reporting and use `onShellError` to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.

* * *

### Recovering from errors outside the shell[](#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell "Link for Recovering from errors outside the shell ")

In this example, the `<Posts />` component is wrapped in `<Suspense>` so it is _not_ a part of the shell:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

If an error happens in the `Posts` component or somewhere inside it, React will [try to recover from it:](/reference/react/Suspense#providing-a-fallback-for-server-errors-and-client-only-content)

1.  It will emit the loading fallback for the closest `<Suspense>` boundary (`PostsGlimmer`) into the HTML.
2.  It will “give up” on trying to render the `Posts` content on the server anymore.
3.  When the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will _retry_ rendering `Posts` on the client.

If retrying rendering `Posts` on the client _also_ fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the [closest parent error boundary](/reference/react/Component#static-getderivedstatefromerror) determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.

If retrying rendering `Posts` on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server `onError` callback and the client [`onRecoverableError`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrateroot) callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.

* * *

### Setting the status code[](#setting-the-status-code "Link for Setting the status code ")

Streaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.

By [dividing your app](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell) into the shell (above all `<Suspense>` boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, you’ll get the `onShellError` callback which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.

    const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    response.statusCode = 200;    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    pipe(response);  },  onShellError(error) {    response.statusCode = 500;    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>');   },  onError(error) {    console.error(error);    logServerCrashReport(error);  }});

If a component _outside_ the shell (i.e. inside a `<Suspense>` boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the `onError` callback will fire, but you will still get `onShellReady` instead of `onShellError`. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, [as described above.](#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell)

However, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:

    let didError = false;const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    pipe(response);  },  onShellError(error) {    response.statusCode = 500;    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>');   },  onError(error) {    didError = true;    console.error(error);    logServerCrashReport(error);  }});

This will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.

* * *

### Handling different errors in different ways[](#handling-different-errors-in-different-ways "Link for Handling different errors in different ways ")

You can [create your own `Error` subclasses](https://javascript.info/custom-errors) and use the [`instanceof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof) operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom `NotFoundError` and throw it from your component. Then your `onError`, `onShellReady`, and `onShellError` callbacks can do something different depending on the error type:

    let didError = false;let caughtError = null;function getStatusCode() {  if (didError) {    if (caughtError instanceof NotFoundError) {      return 404;    } else {      return 500;    }  } else {    return 200;  }}const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    response.statusCode = getStatusCode();    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    pipe(response);  },  onShellError(error) {   response.statusCode = getStatusCode();   response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');   response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>');   },  onError(error) {    didError = true;    caughtError = error;    console.error(error);    logServerCrashReport(error);  }});

Keep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.

* * *

### Waiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation[](#waiting-for-all-content-to-load-for-crawlers-and-static-generation "Link for Waiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation ")

Streaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.

However, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.

You can wait for all the content to load using the `onAllReady` callback:

    let didError = false;let isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ...const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],  onShellReady() {    if (!isCrawler) {      response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');      pipe(response);    }  },  onShellError(error) {    response.statusCode = 500;    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>');   },  onAllReady() {    if (isCrawler) {      response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');      pipe(response);          }  },  onError(error) {    didError = true;    console.error(error);    logServerCrashReport(error);  }});

A regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for _all_ data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.

* * *

### Aborting server rendering[](#aborting-server-rendering "Link for Aborting server rendering ")

You can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:

    const { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {  // ...});setTimeout(() => {  abort();}, 10000);

React will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `renderToReadableStream(reactNode, options?)`[](#rendertoreadablestream "Link for this heading")

Call `renderToReadableStream` to render your React tree as HTML into a [Readable Web Stream.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)

    import { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server';async function handler(request) {  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']  });  return new Response(stream, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

On the client, call [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) to make the server-generated HTML interactive.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `reactNode`: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like `<App />`. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the `App` component should render the `<html>` tag.
    
*   **optional** `options`: An object with streaming options.
    
    *   **optional** `bootstrapScriptContent`: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline `<script>` tag.
    *   **optional** `bootstrapScripts`: An array of string URLs for the `<script>` tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the `<script>` that calls [`hydrateRoot`.](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.
    *   **optional** `bootstrapModules`: Like `bootstrapScripts`, but emits [`<script type="module">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) instead.
    *   **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to [`hydrateRoot`.](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#parameters)
    *   **optional** `namespaceURI`: A string with the root [namespace URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElementNS#important_namespace_uris) for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass `'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'` for SVG or `'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'` for MathML.
    *   **optional** `nonce`: A [`nonce`](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#nonce) string to allow scripts for [`script-src` Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src).
    *   **optional** `onError`: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether [recoverable](#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell) or [not.](#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell) By default, this only calls `console.error`. If you override it to [log crash reports,](#logging-crashes-on-the-server) make sure that you still call `console.error`. You can also use it to [adjust the status code](#setting-the-status-code) before the shell is emitted.
    *   **optional** `progressiveChunkSize`: The number of bytes in a chunk. [Read more about the default heuristic.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/14c2be8dac2d5482fda8a0906a31d239df8551fc/packages/react-server/src/ReactFizzServer.js#L210-L225)
    *   **optional** `signal`: An [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that lets you [abort server rendering](#aborting-server-rendering) and render the rest on the client.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`renderToReadableStream` returns a Promise:

*   If rendering the [shell](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell) is successful, that Promise will resolve to a [Readable Web Stream.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)
*   If rendering the shell fails, the Promise will be rejected. [Use this to output a fallback shell.](#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell)

The returned stream has an additional property:

*   `allReady`: A Promise that resolves when all rendering is complete, including both the [shell](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell) and all additional [content.](#streaming-more-content-as-it-loads) You can `await stream.allReady` before returning a response [for crawlers and static generation.](#waiting-for-all-content-to-load-for-crawlers-and-static-generation) If you do that, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML.

---------------------------------

### Rendering a React tree as HTML to a Readable Web Stream[](#rendering-a-react-tree-as-html-to-a-readable-web-stream "Link for Rendering a React tree as HTML to a Readable Web Stream ")

Call `renderToReadableStream` to render your React tree as HTML into a [Readable Web Stream:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)

    import { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server';async function handler(request) {  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']  });  return new Response(stream, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

Along with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap `<script>` paths. Your root component should return **the entire document including the root `<html>` tag.**

For example, it might look like this:

    export default function App() {  return (    <html>      <head>        <meta charSet="utf-8" />        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"></link>        <title>My app</title>      </head>      <body>        <Router />      </body>    </html>  );}

React will inject the [doctype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype) and your bootstrap `<script>` tags into the resulting HTML stream:

    <!DOCTYPE html><html>  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... --></html><script src="/main.js" async=""></script>

On the client, your bootstrap script should [hydrate the entire `document` with a call to `hydrateRoot`:](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-an-entire-document)

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App />);

This will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.

##### Deep Dive

#### Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output[](#reading-css-and-js-asset-paths-from-the-build-output "Link for Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output ")

Show Details

The final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build. For example, instead of `styles.css` you might end up with `styles.123456.css`. Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content.

However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding `"/styles.css"` into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop:

    export default function App({ assetMap }) {  return (    <html>      <head>        <title>My app</title>        <link rel="stylesheet" href={assetMap['styles.css']}></link>      </head>      ...    </html>  );}

On the server, render `<App assetMap={assetMap} />` and pass your `assetMap` with the asset URLs:

    // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = {  'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css',  'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};async function handler(request) {  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, {    bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['/main.js']]  });  return new Response(stream, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

Since your server is now rendering `<App assetMap={assetMap} />`, you need to render it with `assetMap` on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass `assetMap` to the client like this:

    // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = {  'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css',  'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};async function handler(request) {  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, {    // Careful: It's safe to stringify() this because this data isn't user-generated.    bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`,    bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['/main.js']],  });  return new Response(stream, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

In the example above, the `bootstrapScriptContent` option adds an extra inline `<script>` tag that sets the global `window.assetMap` variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same `assetMap`:

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />);

Both client and server render `App` with the same `assetMap` prop, so there are no hydration errors.

### Streaming more content as it loads[](#streaming-more-content-as-it-loads "Link for Streaming more content as it loads ")

Streaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Sidebar>        <Friends />        <Photos />      </Sidebar>      <Posts />    </ProfileLayout>  );}

Imagine that loading data for `<Posts />` takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, [wrap `Posts` in a `<Suspense>` boundary:](/reference/react/Suspense#displaying-a-fallback-while-content-is-loading)

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Sidebar>        <Friends />        <Photos />      </Sidebar>      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

This tells React to start streaming the HTML before `Posts` loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (`PostsGlimmer`) first, and then, when `Posts` finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline `<script>` tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the `PostsGlimmer`, later replaced by the `Posts`.

You can further [nest `<Suspense>` boundaries](/reference/react/Suspense#revealing-nested-content-as-it-loads) to create a more granular loading sequence:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>        <Sidebar>          <Friends />          <Photos />        </Sidebar>        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>          <Posts />        </Suspense>      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

In this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only `ProfileLayout` and `ProfileCover` must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any `<Suspense>` boundary. However, if `Sidebar`, `Friends`, or `Photos` need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the `BigSpinner` fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.

Streaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the `<script>` tags load.

[Read more about how streaming HTML works.](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37)

### Note

**Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component.** They include:

*   Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)
*   Lazy-loading component code with [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy)
*   Reading the value of a Promise with [`use`](/reference/react/use)

Suspense **does not** detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.

The exact way you would load data in the `Posts` component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.

Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.

### Specifying what goes into the shell[](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell "Link for Specifying what goes into the shell ")

The part of your app outside of any `<Suspense>` boundaries is called _the shell:_

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>        <Sidebar>          <Friends />          <Photos />        </Sidebar>        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>          <Posts />        </Suspense>      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

It determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:

    <ProfileLayout>  <ProfileCover />  <BigSpinner /></ProfileLayout>

If you wrap the whole app into a `<Suspense>` boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the `<Suspense>` boundaries so that the shell feels _minimal but complete_—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.

The async call to `renderToReadableStream` will resolve to a `stream` as soon as the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then by creating and returning a response with that `stream`:

    async function handler(request) {  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']  });  return new Response(stream, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

By the time the `stream` is returned, components in nested `<Suspense>` boundaries might still be loading data.

* * *

### Logging crashes on the server[](#logging-crashes-on-the-server "Link for Logging crashes on the server ")

By default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:

    async function handler(request) {  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],    onError(error) {      console.error(error);      logServerCrashReport(error);    }  });  return new Response(stream, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

If you provide a custom `onError` implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.

* * *

### Recovering from errors inside the shell[](#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell "Link for Recovering from errors inside the shell ")

In this example, the shell contains `ProfileLayout`, `ProfileCover`, and `PostsGlimmer`:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

If an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Wrap your `renderToReadableStream` call in a `try...catch` to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:

    async function handler(request) {  try {    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],      onError(error) {        console.error(error);        logServerCrashReport(error);      }    });    return new Response(stream, {      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  } catch (error) {    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {      status: 500,      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  }}

If there is an error while generating the shell, both `onError` and your `catch` block will fire. Use `onError` for error reporting and use the `catch` block to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.

* * *

### Recovering from errors outside the shell[](#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell "Link for Recovering from errors outside the shell ")

In this example, the `<Posts />` component is wrapped in `<Suspense>` so it is _not_ a part of the shell:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

If an error happens in the `Posts` component or somewhere inside it, React will [try to recover from it:](/reference/react/Suspense#providing-a-fallback-for-server-errors-and-client-only-content)

1.  It will emit the loading fallback for the closest `<Suspense>` boundary (`PostsGlimmer`) into the HTML.
2.  It will “give up” on trying to render the `Posts` content on the server anymore.
3.  When the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will _retry_ rendering `Posts` on the client.

If retrying rendering `Posts` on the client _also_ fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the [closest parent error boundary](/reference/react/Component#static-getderivedstatefromerror) determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.

If retrying rendering `Posts` on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server `onError` callback and the client [`onRecoverableError`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrateroot) callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.

* * *

### Setting the status code[](#setting-the-status-code "Link for Setting the status code ")

Streaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.

By [dividing your app](#specifying-what-goes-into-the-shell) into the shell (above all `<Suspense>` boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, your `catch` block will run which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.

    async function handler(request) {  try {    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],      onError(error) {        console.error(error);        logServerCrashReport(error);      }    });    return new Response(stream, {      status: 200,      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  } catch (error) {    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {      status: 500,      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  }}

If a component _outside_ the shell (i.e. inside a `<Suspense>` boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the `onError` callback will fire, but your code will continue running without getting into the `catch` block. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, [as described above.](#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell)

However, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:

    async function handler(request) {  try {    let didError = false;    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],      onError(error) {        didError = true;        console.error(error);        logServerCrashReport(error);      }    });    return new Response(stream, {      status: didError ? 500 : 200,      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  } catch (error) {    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {      status: 500,      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  }}

This will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.

* * *

### Handling different errors in different ways[](#handling-different-errors-in-different-ways "Link for Handling different errors in different ways ")

You can [create your own `Error` subclasses](https://javascript.info/custom-errors) and use the [`instanceof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof) operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom `NotFoundError` and throw it from your component. Then you can save the error in `onError` and do something different before returning the response depending on the error type:

    async function handler(request) {  let didError = false;  let caughtError = null;  function getStatusCode() {    if (didError) {      if (caughtError instanceof NotFoundError) {        return 404;      } else {        return 500;      }    } else {      return 200;    }  }  try {    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],      onError(error) {        didError = true;        caughtError = error;        console.error(error);        logServerCrashReport(error);      }    });    return new Response(stream, {      status: getStatusCode(),      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  } catch (error) {    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {      status: getStatusCode(),      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  }}

Keep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.

* * *

### Waiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation[](#waiting-for-all-content-to-load-for-crawlers-and-static-generation "Link for Waiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation ")

Streaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.

However, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.

You can wait for all the content to load by awaiting the `stream.allReady` Promise:

    async function handler(request) {  try {    let didError = false;    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],      onError(error) {        didError = true;        console.error(error);        logServerCrashReport(error);      }    });    let isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ...    if (isCrawler) {      await stream.allReady;    }    return new Response(stream, {      status: didError ? 500 : 200,      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  } catch (error) {    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {      status: 500,      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },    });  }}

A regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for _all_ data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.

* * *

### Aborting server rendering[](#aborting-server-rendering "Link for Aborting server rendering ")

You can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:

    async function handler(request) {  try {    const controller = new AbortController();    setTimeout(() => {      controller.abort();    }, 10000);    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {      signal: controller.signal,      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],      onError(error) {        didError = true;        console.error(error);        logServerCrashReport(error);      }    });    // ...

React will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.

On the server, call `renderToStaticMarkup` to render your app to HTML.

    import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server';const html = renderToStaticMarkup(<Page />);

It will produce non-interactive HTML output of your React components.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `reactNode`: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX node like `<Page />`.
*   **optional** `options`: An object for server render.
    *   **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

An HTML string.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `renderToStaticMarkup` output cannot be hydrated.
    
*   `renderToStaticMarkup` has limited Suspense support. If a component suspends, `renderToStaticMarkup` immediately sends its fallback as HTML.

---------------------------------

### Rendering a non-interactive React tree as HTML to a string[](#rendering-a-non-interactive-react-tree-as-html-to-a-string "Link for Rendering a non-interactive React tree as HTML to a string ")

Call `renderToStaticMarkup` to render your app to an HTML string which you can send with your server response:

    import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server';// The route handler syntax depends on your backend frameworkapp.use('/', (request, response) => {  const html = renderToStaticMarkup(<Page />);  response.send(html);});

This will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components.

### Pitfall

This method renders **non-interactive HTML that cannot be hydrated.** This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, or if you’re rendering completely static content like emails.

Interactive apps should use [`renderToString`](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToString) on the server and [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) on the client.

We recommend using these fully-featured alternatives:

*   If you use Node.js, use [`prerenderToNodeStream`.](/reference/react-dom/static/prerenderToNodeStream)
*   If you use Deno or a modern edge runtime with [Web Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API), use [`prerender`.](/reference/react-dom/static/prerender)

You can continue using `renderToString` if your static site generation environment does not support streams.

* * *

### Removing `renderToString` from the client code[](#removing-rendertostring-from-the-client-code "Link for this heading")

Sometimes, `renderToString` is used on the client to convert some component to HTML.

    // 🚩 Unnecessary: using renderToString on the clientimport { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';const html = renderToString(<MyIcon />);console.log(html); // For example, "<svg>...</svg>"

Importing `react-dom/server` **on the client** unnecessarily increases your bundle size and should be avoided. If you need to render some component to HTML in the browser, use [`createRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot) and read HTML from the DOM:

    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';const div = document.createElement('div');const root = createRoot(div);flushSync(() => {  root.render(<MyIcon />);});console.log(div.innerHTML); // For example, "<svg>...</svg>"

The [`flushSync`](/reference/react-dom/flushSync) call is necessary so that the DOM is updated before reading its [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) property.

* * *

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### When a component suspends, the HTML always contains a fallback[](#when-a-component-suspends-the-html-always-contains-a-fallback "Link for When a component suspends, the HTML always contains a fallback ")

`renderToString` does not fully support Suspense.

If some component suspends (for example, because it’s defined with [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy) or fetches data), `renderToString` will not wait for its content to resolve. Instead, `renderToString` will find the closest [`<Suspense>`](/reference/react/Suspense) boundary above it and render its `fallback` prop in the HTML. The content will not appear until the client code loads.

To solve this, use one of the [recommended streaming solutions.](#alternatives) For server side rendering, they can stream content in chunks as it resolves on the server so that the user sees the page being progressively filled in before the client code loads. For static site generation, they can wait for all the content to resolve before generating the static HTML.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `prerender(reactNode, options?)`[](#prerender "Link for this heading")

Call `prerender` to render your app to static HTML.

    import { prerender } from 'react-dom/static';async function handler(request) {  const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']  });  return new Response(prelude, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

On the client, call [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) to make the server-generated HTML interactive.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `reactNode`: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX node like `<App />`. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the `<html>` tag.
    
*   **optional** `options`: An object with static generation options.
    
    *   **optional** `bootstrapScriptContent`: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline `<script>` tag.
    *   **optional** `bootstrapScripts`: An array of string URLs for the `<script>` tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the `<script>` that calls [`hydrateRoot`.](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.
    *   **optional** `bootstrapModules`: Like `bootstrapScripts`, but emits [`<script type="module">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) instead.
    *   **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to [`hydrateRoot`.](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#parameters)
    *   **optional** `namespaceURI`: A string with the root [namespace URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElementNS#important_namespace_uris) for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass `'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'` for SVG or `'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'` for MathML.
    *   **optional** `onError`: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether [recoverable](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell) or [not.](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell) By default, this only calls `console.error`. If you override it to [log crash reports,](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream#logging-crashes-on-the-server) make sure that you still call `console.error`. You can also use it to [adjust the status code](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream#setting-the-status-code) before the shell is emitted.
    *   **optional** `progressiveChunkSize`: The number of bytes in a chunk. [Read more about the default heuristic.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/14c2be8dac2d5482fda8a0906a31d239df8551fc/packages/react-server/src/ReactFizzServer.js#L210-L225)
    *   **optional** `signal`: An [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that lets you [abort server rendering](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream#aborting-server-rendering) and render the rest on the client.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`prerender` returns a Promise:

*   If rendering the is successful, the Promise will resolve to an object containing:
    *   `prelude`: a [Web Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) of HTML. You can use this stream to send a response in chunks, or you can read the entire stream into a string.
*   If rendering fails, the Promise will be rejected. [Use this to output a fallback shell.](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell)

### Note

### When should I use `prerender`?[](#when-to-use-prerender "Link for this heading")

The static `prerender` API is used for static server-side generation (SSG). Unlike `renderToString`, `prerender` waits for all data to load before resolving. This makes it suitable for generating static HTML for a full page, including data that needs to be fetched using Suspense. To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server-side render (SSR) API like [renderToReadableStream](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream).

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Rendering a React tree to a stream of static HTML[](#rendering-a-react-tree-to-a-stream-of-static-html "Link for Rendering a React tree to a stream of static HTML ")

Call `prerender` to render your React tree to static HTML into a [Readable Web Stream:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream):

    import { prerender } from 'react-dom/static';async function handler(request) {  const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']  });  return new Response(prelude, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

Along with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap `<script>` paths. Your root component should return **the entire document including the root `<html>` tag.**

For example, it might look like this:

    export default function App() {  return (    <html>      <head>        <meta charSet="utf-8" />        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"></link>        <title>My app</title>      </head>      <body>        <Router />      </body>    </html>  );}

React will inject the [doctype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype) and your bootstrap `<script>` tags into the resulting HTML stream:

    <!DOCTYPE html><html>  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... --></html><script src="/main.js" async=""></script>

On the client, your bootstrap script should [hydrate the entire `document` with a call to `hydrateRoot`:](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-an-entire-document)

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App />);

This will attach event listeners to the static server-generated HTML and make it interactive.

##### Deep Dive

#### Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output[](#reading-css-and-js-asset-paths-from-the-build-output "Link for Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output ")

Show Details

The final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build. For example, instead of `styles.css` you might end up with `styles.123456.css`. Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content.

However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding `"/styles.css"` into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop:

    export default function App({ assetMap }) {  return (    <html>      <head>        <title>My app</title>        <link rel="stylesheet" href={assetMap['styles.css']}></link>      </head>      ...    </html>  );}

On the server, render `<App assetMap={assetMap} />` and pass your `assetMap` with the asset URLs:

    // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = {  'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css',  'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};async function handler(request) {  const {prelude} = await prerender(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, {    bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['/main.js']]  });  return new Response(prelude, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

Since your server is now rendering `<App assetMap={assetMap} />`, you need to render it with `assetMap` on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass `assetMap` to the client like this:

    // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = {  'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css',  'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};async function handler(request) {  const {prelude} = await prerender(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, {    // Careful: It's safe to stringify() this because this data isn't user-generated.    bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`,    bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['/main.js']],  });  return new Response(prelude, {    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },  });}

In the example above, the `bootstrapScriptContent` option adds an extra inline `<script>` tag that sets the global `window.assetMap` variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same `assetMap`:

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />);

Both client and server render `App` with the same `assetMap` prop, so there are no hydration errors.

* * *

### Rendering a React tree to a string of static HTML[](#rendering-a-react-tree-to-a-string-of-static-html "Link for Rendering a React tree to a string of static HTML ")

Call `prerender` to render your app to a static HTML string:

    import { prerender } from 'react-dom/static';async function renderToString() {  const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']  });    const reader = prelude.getReader();  let content = '';  while (true) {    const {done, value} = await reader.read();    if (done) {      return content;    }    content += Buffer.from(value).toString('utf8');  }}

This will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components. On the client, you will need to call [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) to _hydrate_ that server-generated HTML and make it interactive.

* * *

### Waiting for all data to load[](#waiting-for-all-data-to-load "Link for Waiting for all data to load ")

`prerender` waits for all data to load before finishing the static HTML generation and resolving. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Sidebar>        <Friends />        <Photos />      </Sidebar>      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

Imagine that `<Posts />` needs to load some data, which takes some time. Ideally, you’d want wait for the posts to finish so it’s included in the HTML. To do this, you can use Suspense to suspend on the data, and `prerender` will wait for the suspended content to finish before resolving to the static HTML.

### Note

**Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component.** They include:

*   Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)
*   Lazy-loading component code with [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy)
*   Reading the value of a Promise with [`use`](/reference/react/use)

Suspense **does not** detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.

The exact way you would load data in the `Posts` component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.

Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My stream doesn’t start until the entire app is rendered[](#my-stream-doesnt-start-until-the-entire-app-is-rendered "Link for My stream doesn’t start until the entire app is rendered ")

The `prerender` response waits for the entire app to finish rendering, including waiting for all Suspense boundaries to resolve, before resolving. It is designed for static site generation (SSG) ahead of time and does not support streaming more content as it loads.

To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server render API like [renderToReadableStream](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream).

Since your server is now rendering `<App assetMap={assetMap} />`, you need to render it with `assetMap` on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass `assetMap` to the client like this:

    // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = {  'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css',  'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};app.use('/', async (request, response) => {  const { prelude } = await prerenderToNodeStream(<App />, {    // Careful: It's safe to stringify() this because this data isn't user-generated.    bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`,    bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['/main.js']],  });  response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');  prelude.pipe(response);});

In the example above, the `bootstrapScriptContent` option adds an extra inline `<script>` tag that sets the global `window.assetMap` variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same `assetMap`:

    import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />);

Both client and server render `App` with the same `assetMap` prop, so there are no hydration errors.

### Rendering a React tree to a string of static HTML[](#rendering-a-react-tree-to-a-string-of-static-html "Link for Rendering a React tree to a string of static HTML ")

Call `prerenderToNodeStream` to render your app to a static HTML string:

    import { prerenderToNodeStream } from 'react-dom/static';async function renderToString() {  const {prelude} = await prerenderToNodeStream(<App />, {    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']  });    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    let data = '';    prelude.on('data', chunk => {      data += chunk;    });    prelude.on('end', () => resolve(data));    prelude.on('error', reject);  });}

This will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components. On the client, you will need to call [`hydrateRoot`](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) to _hydrate_ that server-generated HTML and make it interactive.

* * *

### Waiting for all data to load[](#waiting-for-all-data-to-load "Link for Waiting for all data to load ")

`prerenderToNodeStream` waits for all data to load before finishing the static HTML generation and resolving. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:

    function ProfilePage() {  return (    <ProfileLayout>      <ProfileCover />      <Sidebar>        <Friends />        <Photos />      </Sidebar>      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>        <Posts />      </Suspense>    </ProfileLayout>  );}

Imagine that `<Posts />` needs to load some data, which takes some time. Ideally, you’d want wait for the posts to finish so it’s included in the HTML. To do this, you can use Suspense to suspend on the data, and `prerenderToNodeStream` will wait for the suspended content to finish before resolving to the static HTML.

### Note

**Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component.** They include:

*   Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)
*   Lazy-loading component code with [`lazy`](/reference/react/lazy)
*   Reading the value of a Promise with [`use`](/reference/react/use)

Suspense **does not** detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.

The exact way you would load data in the `Posts` component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.

Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.

### My stream doesn’t start until the entire app is rendered[](#my-stream-doesnt-start-until-the-entire-app-is-rendered "Link for My stream doesn’t start until the entire app is rendered ")

The `prerenderToNodeStream` response waits for the entire app to finish rendering, including waiting for all Suspense boundaries to resolve, before resolving. It is designed for static site generation (SSG) ahead of time and does not support streaming more content as it loads.

To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server render API like [renderToPipeableStream](/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream).

Rules of React[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
====================================================

Just as different programming languages have their own ways of expressing concepts, React has its own idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications.

*   [Components and Hooks must be pure](#components-and-hooks-must-be-pure)
*   [React calls Components and Hooks](#react-calls-components-and-hooks)
*   [Rules of Hooks](#rules-of-hooks)

* * *

### Note

To learn more about expressing UIs with React, we recommend reading [Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react).

This section describes the rules you need to follow to write idiomatic React code. Writing idiomatic React code can help you write well organized, safe, and composable applications. These properties make your app more resilient to changes and makes it easier to work with other developers, libraries, and tools.

These rules are known as the **Rules of React**. They are rules – and not just guidelines – in the sense that if they are broken, your app likely has bugs. Your code also becomes unidiomatic and harder to understand and reason about.

We strongly recommend using [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) alongside React’s [ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) to help your codebase follow the Rules of React. By following the Rules of React, you’ll be able to find and address these bugs and keep your application maintainable.

*   [Props and state are immutable](/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure#props-and-state-are-immutable) – A component’s props and state are immutable snapshots with respect to a single render. Never mutate them directly.
*   [Return values and arguments to Hooks are immutable](/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure#return-values-and-arguments-to-hooks-are-immutable) – Once values are passed to a Hook, you should not modify them. Like props in JSX, values become immutable when passed to a Hook.
*   [Values are immutable after being passed to JSX](/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure#values-are-immutable-after-being-passed-to-jsx) – Don’t mutate values after they’ve been used in JSX. Move the mutation before the JSX is created.

### Why does purity matter?[](#why-does-purity-matter "Link for Why does purity matter? ")

One of the key concepts that makes React, _React_ is _purity_. A pure component or hook is one that is:

*   **Idempotent** – You [always get the same result every time](/learn/keeping-components-pure#purity-components-as-formulas) you run it with the same inputs – props, state, context for component inputs; and arguments for hook inputs.
*   **Has no side effects in render** – Code with side effects should run [**separately from rendering**](#how-does-react-run-your-code). For example as an [event handler](/learn/responding-to-events) – where the user interacts with the UI and causes it to update; or as an [Effect](/reference/react/useEffect) – which runs after render.
*   **Does not mutate non-local values**: Components and Hooks should [never modify values that aren’t created locally](#mutation) in render.

When render is kept pure, React can understand how to prioritize which updates are most important for the user to see first. This is made possible because of render purity: since components don’t have side effects [in render](#how-does-react-run-your-code), React can pause rendering components that aren’t as important to update, and only come back to them later when it’s needed.

Concretely, this means that rendering logic can be run multiple times in a way that allows React to give your user a pleasant user experience. However, if your component has an untracked side effect – like modifying the value of a global variable [during render](#how-does-react-run-your-code) – when React runs your rendering code again, your side effects will be triggered in a way that won’t match what you want. This often leads to unexpected bugs that can degrade how your users experience your app. You can see an [example of this in the Keeping Components Pure page](/learn/keeping-components-pure#side-effects-unintended-consequences).

#### How does React run your code?[](#how-does-react-run-your-code "Link for How does React run your code? ")

React is declarative: you tell React _what_ to render, and React will figure out _how_ best to display it to your user. To do this, React has a few phases where it runs your code. You don’t need to know about all of these phases to use React well. But at a high level, you should know about what code runs in _render_, and what runs outside of it.

_Rendering_ refers to calculating what the next version of your UI should look like. After rendering, [Effects](/reference/react/useEffect) are _flushed_ (meaning they are run until there are no more left) and may update the calculation if the Effects have impacts on layout. React takes this new calculation and compares it to the calculation used to create the previous version of your UI, then _commits_ just the minimum changes needed to the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) (what your user actually sees) to catch it up to the latest version.

##### Deep Dive

#### How to tell if code runs in render[](#how-to-tell-if-code-runs-in-render "Link for How to tell if code runs in render ")

Show Details

One quick heuristic to tell if code runs during render is to examine where it is: if it’s written at the top level like in the example below, there’s a good chance it runs during render.

    function Dropdown() {  const selectedItems = new Set(); // created during render  // ...}

Event handlers and Effects don’t run in render:

    function Dropdown() {  const selectedItems = new Set();  const onSelect = (item) => {    // this code is in an event handler, so it's only run when the user triggers this    selectedItems.add(item);  }}

    function Dropdown() {  const selectedItems = new Set();  useEffect(() => {    // this code is inside of an Effect, so it only runs after rendering    logForAnalytics(selectedItems);  }, [selectedItems]);}

* * *

Components and Hooks must be idempotent[](#components-and-hooks-must-be-idempotent "Link for Components and Hooks must be idempotent ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components must always return the same output with respect to their inputs – props, state, and context. This is known as _idempotency_. [Idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) is a term popularized in functional programming. It refers to the idea that you [always get the same result every time](/learn/keeping-components-pure) you run that piece of code with the same inputs.

This means that _all_ code that runs [during render](#how-does-react-run-your-code) must also be idempotent in order for this rule to hold. For example, this line of code is not idempotent (and therefore, neither is the component):

    function Clock() {  const time = new Date(); // 🔴 Bad: always returns a different result!  return <span>{time.toLocaleString()}</span>}

`new Date()` is not idempotent as it always returns the current date and changes its result every time it’s called. When you render the above component, the time displayed on the screen will stay stuck on the time that the component was rendered. Similarly, functions like `Math.random()` also aren’t idempotent, because they return different results every time they’re called, even when the inputs are the same.

This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use non-idempotent functions like `new Date()` _at all_ – you should just avoid using them [during render](#how-does-react-run-your-code). In this case, we can _synchronize_ the latest date to this component using an [Effect](/reference/react/useEffect):

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useTime() {
  // 1. Keep track of the current date's state. \`useState\` receives an initializer function as its
  //    initial state. It only runs once when the hook is called, so only the current date at the
  //    time the hook is called is set first.
  const \[time, setTime\] = useState(() \=> new Date());

  useEffect(() \=> {
    // 2. Update the current date every second using \`setInterval\`.
    const id = setInterval(() \=> {
      setTime(new Date()); // ✅ Good: non-idempotent code no longer runs in render
    }, 1000);
    // 3. Return a cleanup function so we don't leak the \`setInterval\` timer.
    return () \=> clearInterval(id);
  }, \[\]);

  return time;
}

export default function Clock() {
  const time = useTime();
  return <span\>{time.toLocaleString()}</span\>;
}

Show more

By wrapping the non-idempotent `new Date()` call in an Effect, it moves that calculation [outside of rendering](#how-does-react-run-your-code).

If you don’t need to synchronize some external state with React, you can also consider using an [event handler](/learn/responding-to-events) if it only needs to be updated in response to a user interaction.

* * *

Side effects must run outside of render[](#side-effects-must-run-outside-of-render "Link for Side effects must run outside of render ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Side effects](/learn/keeping-components-pure#side-effects-unintended-consequences) should not run [in render](#how-does-react-run-your-code), as React can render components multiple times to create the best possible user experience.

### Note

Side effects are a broader term than Effects. Effects specifically refer to code that’s wrapped in `useEffect`, while a side effect is a general term for code that has any observable effect other than its primary result of returning a value to the caller.

Side effects are typically written inside of [event handlers](/learn/responding-to-events) or Effects. But never during render.

While render must be kept pure, side effects are necessary at some point in order for your app to do anything interesting, like showing something on the screen! The key point of this rule is that side effects should not run [in render](#how-does-react-run-your-code), as React can render components multiple times. In most cases, you’ll use [event handlers](/learn/responding-to-events) to handle side effects. Using an event handler explicitly tells React that this code doesn’t need to run during render, keeping render pure. If you’ve exhausted all options – and only as a last resort – you can also handle side effects using `useEffect`.

### When is it okay to have mutation?[](#mutation "Link for When is it okay to have mutation? ")

#### Local mutation[](#local-mutation "Link for Local mutation ")

One common example of a side effect is mutation, which in JavaScript refers to changing the value of a non-[primitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) value. In general, while mutation is not idiomatic in React, _local_ mutation is absolutely fine:

    function FriendList({ friends }) {  const items = []; // ✅ Good: locally created  for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {    const friend = friends[i];    items.push(      <Friend key={friend.id} friend={friend} />    ); // ✅ Good: local mutation is okay  }  return <section>{items}</section>;}

There is no need to contort your code to avoid local mutation. [`Array.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) could also be used here for brevity, but there is nothing wrong with creating a local array and then pushing items into it [during render](#how-does-react-run-your-code).

Even though it looks like we are mutating `items`, the key point to note is that this code only does so _locally_ – the mutation isn’t “remembered” when the component is rendered again. In other words, `items` only stays around as long as the component does. Because `items` is always _recreated_ every time `<FriendList />` is rendered, the component will always return the same result.

On the other hand, if `items` was created outside of the component, it holds on to its previous values and remembers changes:

    const items = []; // 🔴 Bad: created outside of the componentfunction FriendList({ friends }) {  for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {    const friend = friends[i];    items.push(      <Friend key={friend.id} friend={friend} />    ); // 🔴 Bad: mutates a value created outside of render  }  return <section>{items}</section>;}

When `<FriendList />` runs again, we will continue appending `friends` to `items` every time that component is run, leading to multiple duplicated results. This version of `<FriendList />` has observable side effects [during render](#how-does-react-run-your-code) and **breaks the rule**.

#### Lazy initialization[](#lazy-initialization "Link for Lazy initialization ")

Lazy initialization is also fine despite not being fully “pure”:

    function ExpenseForm() {  SuperCalculator.initializeIfNotReady(); // ✅ Good: if it doesn't affect other components  // Continue rendering...}

#### Changing the DOM[](#changing-the-dom "Link for Changing the DOM ")

Side effects that are directly visible to the user are not allowed in the render logic of React components. In other words, merely calling a component function shouldn’t by itself produce a change on the screen.

    function ProductDetailPage({ product }) {  document.title = product.title; // 🔴 Bad: Changes the DOM}

One way to achieve the desired result of updating `document.title` outside of render is to [synchronize the component with `document`](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects).

As long as calling a component multiple times is safe and doesn’t affect the rendering of other components, React doesn’t care if it’s 100% pure in the strict functional programming sense of the word. It is more important that [components must be idempotent](/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure).

* * *

Props and state are immutable[](#props-and-state-are-immutable "Link for Props and state are immutable ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A component’s props and state are immutable [snapshots](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot). Never mutate them directly. Instead, pass new props down, and use the setter function from `useState`.

You can think of the props and state values as snapshots that are updated after rendering. For this reason, you don’t modify the props or state variables directly: instead you pass new props, or use the setter function provided to you to tell React that state needs to update the next time the component is rendered.

### Don’t mutate Props[](#props "Link for Don’t mutate Props ")

Props are immutable because if you mutate them, the application will produce inconsistent output, which can be hard to debug since it may or may not work depending on the circumstance.

    function Post({ item }) {  item.url = new Url(item.url, base); // 🔴 Bad: never mutate props directly  return <Link url={item.url}>{item.title}</Link>;}

    function Post({ item }) {  const url = new Url(item.url, base); // ✅ Good: make a copy instead  return <Link url={url}>{item.title}</Link>;}

### Don’t mutate State[](#state "Link for Don’t mutate State ")

`useState` returns the state variable and a setter to update that state.

    const [stateVariable, setter] = useState(0);

Rather than updating the state variable in-place, we need to update it using the setter function that is returned by `useState`. Changing values on the state variable doesn’t cause the component to update, leaving your users with an outdated UI. Using the setter function informs React that the state has changed, and that we need to queue a re-render to update the UI.

    function Counter() {  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  function handleClick() {    count = count + 1; // 🔴 Bad: never mutate state directly  }  return (    <button onClick={handleClick}>      You pressed me {count} times    </button>  );}

    function Counter() {  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  function handleClick() {    setCount(count + 1); // ✅ Good: use the setter function returned by useState  }  return (    <button onClick={handleClick}>      You pressed me {count} times    </button>  );}

* * *

Return values and arguments to Hooks are immutable[](#return-values-and-arguments-to-hooks-are-immutable "Link for Return values and arguments to Hooks are immutable ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once values are passed to a hook, you should not modify them. Like props in JSX, values become immutable when passed to a hook.

    function useIconStyle(icon) {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  if (icon.enabled) {    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // 🔴 Bad: never mutate hook arguments directly  }  return icon;}

    function useIconStyle(icon) {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  const newIcon = { ...icon }; // ✅ Good: make a copy instead  if (icon.enabled) {    newIcon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme);  }  return newIcon;}

One important principle in React is _local reasoning_: the ability to understand what a component or hook does by looking at its code in isolation. Hooks should be treated like “black boxes” when they are called. For example, a custom hook might have used its arguments as dependencies to memoize values inside it:

    function useIconStyle(icon) {  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  return useMemo(() => {    const newIcon = { ...icon };    if (icon.enabled) {      newIcon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme);    }    return newIcon;  }, [icon, theme]);}

If you were to mutate the Hooks arguments, the custom hook’s memoization will become incorrect, so it’s important to avoid doing that.

    style = useIconStyle(icon);         // `style` is memoized based on `icon`icon.enabled = false;               // Bad: 🔴 never mutate hook arguments directlystyle = useIconStyle(icon);         // previously memoized result is returned

    style = useIconStyle(icon);         // `style` is memoized based on `icon`icon = { ...icon, enabled: false }; // Good: ✅ make a copy insteadstyle = useIconStyle(icon);         // new value of `style` is calculated

Similarly, it’s important to not modify the return values of Hooks, as they may have been memoized.

* * *

Values are immutable after being passed to JSX[](#values-are-immutable-after-being-passed-to-jsx "Link for Values are immutable after being passed to JSX ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don’t mutate values after they’ve been used in JSX. Move the mutation before the JSX is created.

When you use JSX in an expression, React may eagerly evaluate the JSX before the component finishes rendering. This means that mutating values after they’ve been passed to JSX can lead to outdated UIs, as React won’t know to update the component’s output.

    function Page({ colour }) {  const styles = { colour, size: "large" };  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;  styles.size = "small"; // 🔴 Bad: styles was already used in the JSX above  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;  return (    <>      {header}      <Content />      {footer}    </>  );}

    function Page({ colour }) {  const headerStyles = { colour, size: "large" };  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;  const footerStyles = { colour, size: "small" }; // ✅ Good: we created a new value  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;  return (    <>      {header}      <Content />      {footer}    </>  );}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Components should only be used in JSX. Don’t call them as regular functions. React should call it.

React must decide when your component function is called [during rendering](/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure#how-does-react-run-your-code). In React, you do this using JSX.

    function BlogPost() {  return <Layout><Article /></Layout>; // ✅ Good: Only use components in JSX}

    function BlogPost() {  return <Layout>{Article()}</Layout>; // 🔴 Bad: Never call them directly}

If a component contains Hooks, it’s easy to violate the [Rules of Hooks](/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) when components are called directly in a loop or conditionally.

Letting React orchestrate rendering also allows a number of benefits:

*   **Components become more than functions.** React can augment them with features like _local state_ through Hooks that are tied to the component’s identity in the tree.
*   **Component types participate in reconciliation.** By letting React call your components, you also tell it more about the conceptual structure of your tree. For example, when you move from rendering `<Feed>` to the `<Profile>` page, React won’t attempt to re-use them.
*   **React can enhance your user experience.** For example, it can let the browser do some work between component calls so that re-rendering a large component tree doesn’t block the main thread.
*   **A better debugging story.** If components are first-class citizens that the library is aware of, we can build rich developer tools for introspection in development.
*   **More efficient reconciliation.** React can decide exactly which components in the tree need re-rendering and skip over the ones that don’t. That makes your app faster and more snappy.

* * *

Never pass around Hooks as regular values[](#never-pass-around-hooks-as-regular-values "Link for Never pass around Hooks as regular values ")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hooks should only be called inside of components or Hooks. Never pass it around as a regular value.

Hooks allow you to augment a component with React features. They should always be called as a function, and never passed around as a regular value. This enables _local reasoning_, or the ability for developers to understand everything a component can do by looking at that component in isolation.

Breaking this rule will cause React to not automatically optimize your component.

### Don’t dynamically mutate a Hook[](#dont-dynamically-mutate-a-hook "Link for Don’t dynamically mutate a Hook ")

Hooks should be as “static” as possible. This means you shouldn’t dynamically mutate them. For example, this means you shouldn’t write higher order Hooks:

    function ChatInput() {  const useDataWithLogging = withLogging(useData); // 🔴 Bad: don't write higher order Hooks  const data = useDataWithLogging();}

Hooks should be immutable and not be mutated. Instead of mutating a Hook dynamically, create a static version of the Hook with the desired functionality.

    function ChatInput() {  const data = useDataWithLogging(); // ✅ Good: Create a new version of the Hook}function useDataWithLogging() {  // ... Create a new version of the Hook and inline the logic here}

### Don’t dynamically use Hooks[](#dont-dynamically-use-hooks "Link for Don’t dynamically use Hooks ")

Hooks should also not be dynamically used: for example, instead of doing dependency injection in a component by passing a Hook as a value:

    function ChatInput() {  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} /> // 🔴 Bad: don't pass Hooks as props}

You should always inline the call of the Hook into that component and handle any logic in there.

    function ChatInput() {  return <Button />}function Button() {  const data = useDataWithLogging(); // ✅ Good: Use the Hook directly}function useDataWithLogging() {  // If there's any conditional logic to change the Hook's behavior, it should be inlined into  // the Hook}

This way, `<Button />` is much easier to understand and debug. When Hooks are used in dynamic ways, it increases the complexity of your app greatly and inhibits local reasoning, making your team less productive in the long term. It also makes it easier to accidentally break the [Rules of Hooks](/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) that Hooks should not be called conditionally. If you find yourself needing to mock components for tests, it’s better to mock the server instead to respond with canned data. If possible, it’s also usually more effective to test your app with end-to-end tests.

Rules of Hooks[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
====================================================

Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.

*   [Only call Hooks at the top level](#only-call-hooks-at-the-top-level)
*   [Only call Hooks from React functions](#only-call-hooks-from-react-functions)

* * *

Only call Hooks at the top level[](#only-call-hooks-at-the-top-level "Link for Only call Hooks at the top level ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions whose names start with `use` are called [_Hooks_](/reference/react) in React.

**Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, nested functions, or `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks.** Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. You can only call Hooks while React is rendering a function component:

*   ✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a [function component](/learn/your-first-component).
*   ✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a [custom Hook](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

    function Counter() {  // ✅ Good: top-level in a function component  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // ...}function useWindowWidth() {  // ✅ Good: top-level in a custom Hook  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);  // ...}

It’s **not** supported to call Hooks (functions starting with `use`) in any other cases, for example:

*   🔴 Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops.
*   🔴 Do not call Hooks after a conditional `return` statement.
*   🔴 Do not call Hooks in event handlers.
*   🔴 Do not call Hooks in class components.
*   🔴 Do not call Hooks inside functions passed to `useMemo`, `useReducer`, or `useEffect`.
*   🔴 Do not call Hooks inside `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks.

If you break these rules, you might see this error.

    function Bad({ cond }) {  if (cond) {    // 🔴 Bad: inside a condition (to fix, move it outside!)    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  }  // ...}function Bad() {  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {    // 🔴 Bad: inside a loop (to fix, move it outside!)    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  }  // ...}function Bad({ cond }) {  if (cond) {    return;  }  // 🔴 Bad: after a conditional return (to fix, move it before the return!)  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  // ...}function Bad() {  function handleClick() {    // 🔴 Bad: inside an event handler (to fix, move it outside!)    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  }  // ...}function Bad() {  const style = useMemo(() => {    // 🔴 Bad: inside useMemo (to fix, move it outside!)    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);    return createStyle(theme);  });  // ...}class Bad extends React.Component {  render() {    // 🔴 Bad: inside a class component (to fix, write a function component instead of a class!)    useEffect(() => {})    // ...  }}function Bad() {  try {    // 🔴 Bad: inside try/catch/finally block (to fix, move it outside!)    const [x, setX] = useState(0);  } catch {    const [x, setX] = useState(1);  }}

You can use the [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) to catch these mistakes.

### Note

[Custom Hooks](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) _may_ call other Hooks (that’s their whole purpose). This works because custom Hooks are also supposed to only be called while a function component is rendering.

* * *

Only call Hooks from React functions[](#only-call-hooks-from-react-functions "Link for Only call Hooks from React functions ")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:

✅ Call Hooks from React function components. ✅ Call Hooks from [custom Hooks](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#extracting-your-own-custom-hook-from-a-component).

By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.

    function FriendList() {  const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useOnlineStatus(); // ✅}function setOnlineStatus() { // ❌ Not a component or custom Hook!  const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useOnlineStatus();}

Server Components[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
=======================================================

### React Server Components

Server Components are for use in [React Server Components](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#bleeding-edge-react-frameworks).

Server Components are a new type of Component that renders ahead of time, before bundling, in an environment separate from your client app or SSR server.

This separate environment is the “server” in React Server Components. Server Components can run once at build time on your CI server, or they can be run for each request using a web server.

*   [Async components with Server Components](#async-components-with-server-components)

### Note

#### How do I build support for Server Components?[](#how-do-i-build-support-for-server-components "Link for How do I build support for Server Components? ")

While React Server Components in React 19 are stable and will not break between minor versions, the underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x.

To support React Server Components as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release. We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement React Server Components in the future.

### Server Components without a Server[](#server-components-without-a-server "Link for Server Components without a Server ")

Server components can run at build time to read from the filesystem or fetch static content, so a web server is not required. For example, you may want to read static data from a content management system.

Without Server Components, it’s common to fetch static data on the client with an Effect:

    // bundle.jsimport marked from 'marked'; // 35.9K (11.2K gzipped)import sanitizeHtml from 'sanitize-html'; // 206K (63.3K gzipped)function Page({page}) {  const [content, setContent] = useState('');  // NOTE: loads *after* first page render.  useEffect(() => {    fetch(`/api/content/${page}`).then((data) => {      setContent(data.content);    });  }, [page]);    return <div>{sanitizeHtml(marked(content))}</div>;}

    // api.jsapp.get(`/api/content/:page`, async (req, res) => {  const page = req.params.page;  const content = await file.readFile(`${page}.md`);  res.send({content});});

This pattern means users need to download and parse an additional 75K (gzipped) of libraries, and wait for a second request to fetch the data after the page loads, just to render static content that will not change for the lifetime of the page.

With Server Components, you can render these components once at build time:

    import marked from 'marked'; // Not included in bundleimport sanitizeHtml from 'sanitize-html'; // Not included in bundleasync function Page({page}) {  // NOTE: loads *during* render, when the app is built.  const content = await file.readFile(`${page}.md`);    return <div>{sanitizeHtml(marked(content))}</div>;}

The rendered output can then be server-side rendered (SSR) to HTML and uploaded to a CDN. When the app loads, the client will not see the original `Page` component, or the expensive libraries for rendering the markdown. The client will only see the rendered output:

    <div><!-- html for markdown --></div>

This means the content is visible during first page load, and the bundle does not include the expensive libraries needed to render the static content.

### Note

You may notice that the Server Component above is an async function:

    async function Page({page}) {  //...}

Async Components are a new feature of Server Components that allow you to `await` in render.

See [Async components with Server Components](#async-components-with-server-components) below.

### Server Components with a Server[](#server-components-with-a-server "Link for Server Components with a Server ")

Server Components can also run on a web server during a request for a page, letting you access your data layer without having to build an API. They are rendered before your application is bundled, and can pass data and JSX as props to Client Components.

Without Server Components, it’s common to fetch dynamic data on the client in an Effect:

    // bundle.jsfunction Note({id}) {  const [note, setNote] = useState('');  // NOTE: loads *after* first render.  useEffect(() => {    fetch(`/api/notes/${id}`).then(data => {      setNote(data.note);    });  }, [id]);    return (    <div>      <Author id={note.authorId} />      <p>{note}</p>    </div>  );}function Author({id}) {  const [author, setAuthor] = useState('');  // NOTE: loads *after* Note renders.  // Causing an expensive client-server waterfall.  useEffect(() => {    fetch(`/api/authors/${id}`).then(data => {      setAuthor(data.author);    });  }, [id]);  return <span>By: {author.name}</span>;}

    // apiimport db from './database';app.get(`/api/notes/:id`, async (req, res) => {  const note = await db.notes.get(id);  res.send({note});});app.get(`/api/authors/:id`, async (req, res) => {  const author = await db.authors.get(id);  res.send({author});});

With Server Components, you can read the data and render it in the component:

    import db from './database';async function Note({id}) {  // NOTE: loads *during* render.  const note = await db.notes.get(id);  return (    <div>      <Author id={note.authorId} />      <p>{note}</p>    </div>  );}async function Author({id}) {  // NOTE: loads *after* Note,  // but is fast if data is co-located.  const author = await db.authors.get(id);  return <span>By: {author.name}</span>;}

The bundler then combines the data, rendered Server Components and dynamic Client Components into a bundle. Optionally, that bundle can then be server-side rendered (SSR) to create the initial HTML for the page. When the page loads, the browser does not see the original `Note` and `Author` components; only the rendered output is sent to the client:

    <div>  <span>By: The React Team</span>  <p>React 19 is...</p></div>

Server Components can be made dynamic by re-fetching them from a server, where they can access the data and render again. This new application architecture combines the simple “request/response” mental model of server-centric Multi-Page Apps with the seamless interactivity of client-centric Single-Page Apps, giving you the best of both worlds.

### Adding interactivity to Server Components[](#adding-interactivity-to-server-components "Link for Adding interactivity to Server Components ")

Server Components are not sent to the browser, so they cannot use interactive APIs like `useState`. To add interactivity to Server Components, you can compose them with Client Component using the `"use client"` directive.

### Note

#### There is no directive for Server Components.[](#there-is-no-directive-for-server-components "Link for There is no directive for Server Components. ")

A common misunderstanding is that Server Components are denoted by `"use server"`, but there is no directive for Server Components. The `"use server"` directive is used for Server Functions.

For more info, see the docs for [Directives](/reference/rsc/directives).

In the following example, the `Notes` Server Component imports an `Expandable` Client Component that uses state to toggle its `expanded` state:

    // Server Componentimport Expandable from './Expandable';async function Notes() {  const notes = await db.notes.getAll();  return (    <div>      {notes.map(note => (        <Expandable key={note.id}>          <p note={note} />        </Expandable>      ))}    </div>  )}

    // Client Component"use client"export default function Expandable({children}) {  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);  return (    <div>      <button        onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}      >        Toggle      </button>      {expanded && children}    </div>  )}

This works by first rendering `Notes` as a Server Component, and then instructing the bundler to create a bundle for the Client Component `Expandable`. In the browser, the Client Components will see output of the Server Components passed as props:

    <head>  <!-- the bundle for Client Components -->  <script src="bundle.js" /></head><body>  <div>    <Expandable key={1}>      <p>this is the first note</p>    </Expandable>    <Expandable key={2}>      <p>this is the second note</p>    </Expandable>    <!--...-->  </div> </body>

### Async components with Server Components[](#async-components-with-server-components "Link for Async components with Server Components ")

Server Components introduce a new way to write Components using async/await. When you `await` in an async component, React will suspend and wait for the promise to resolve before resuming rendering. This works across server/client boundaries with streaming support for Suspense.

You can even create a promise on the server, and await it on the client:

    // Server Componentimport db from './database';async function Page({id}) {  // Will suspend the Server Component.  const note = await db.notes.get(id);    // NOTE: not awaited, will start here and await on the client.   const commentsPromise = db.comments.get(note.id);  return (    <div>      {note}      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading Comments...</p>}>        <Comments commentsPromise={commentsPromise} />      </Suspense>    </div>  );}

    // Client Component"use client";import {use} from 'react';function Comments({commentsPromise}) {  // NOTE: this will resume the promise from the server.  // It will suspend until the data is available.  const comments = use(commentsPromise);  return comments.map(commment => <p>{comment}</p>);}

The `note` content is important data for the page to render, so we `await` it on the server. The comments are below the fold and lower-priority, so we start the promise on the server, and wait for it on the client with the `use` API. This will Suspend on the client, without blocking the `note` content from rendering.

Since async components are not supported on the client, we await the promise with `use`.

[API Reference](/reference/react)

Server Functions[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
======================================================

### React Server Components

Server Functions are for use in [React Server Components](/reference/rsc/server-components).

**Note:** Until September 2024, we referred to all Server Functions as “Server Actions”. If a Server Function is passed to an action prop or called from inside an action then it is a Server Action, but not all Server Functions are Server Actions. The naming in this documentation has been updated to reflect that Server Functions can be used for multiple purposes.

Server Functions allow Client Components to call async functions executed on the server.

### Note

#### How do I build support for Server Functions?[](#how-do-i-build-support-for-server-functions "Link for How do I build support for Server Functions? ")

While Server Functions in React 19 are stable and will not break between minor versions, the underlying APIs used to implement Server Functions in a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x.

To support Server Functions as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release. We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement Server Functions in the future.

When a Server Function is defined with the [`"use server"`](/reference/rsc/use-server) directive, your framework will automatically create a reference to the server function, and pass that reference to the Client Component. When that function is called on the client, React will send a request to the server to execute the function, and return the result.

Server Functions can be created in Server Components and passed as props to Client Components, or they can be imported and used in Client Components.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Creating a Server Function from a Server Component[](#creating-a-server-function-from-a-server-component "Link for Creating a Server Function from a Server Component ")

Server Components can define Server Functions with the `"use server"` directive:

    // Server Componentimport Button from './Button';function EmptyNote () {  async function createNoteAction() {    // Server Function    'use server';        await db.notes.create();  }  return <Button onClick={createNoteAction}/>;}

When React renders the `EmptyNote` Server Component, it will create a reference to the `createNoteAction` function, and pass that reference to the `Button` Client Component. When the button is clicked, React will send a request to the server to execute the `createNoteAction` function with the reference provided:

    "use client";export default function Button({onClick}) {   console.log(onClick);   // {$$typeof: Symbol.for("react.server.reference"), $$id: 'createNoteAction'}  return <button onClick={() => onClick()}>Create Empty Note</button>}

For more, see the docs for [`"use server"`](/reference/rsc/use-server).

### Importing Server Functions from Client Components[](#importing-server-functions-from-client-components "Link for Importing Server Functions from Client Components ")

Client Components can import Server Functions from files that use the `"use server"` directive:

    "use server";export async function createNote() {  await db.notes.create();}

When the bundler builds the `EmptyNote` Client Component, it will create a reference to the `createNote` function in the bundle. When the `button` is clicked, React will send a request to the server to execute the `createNote` function using the reference provided:

    "use client";import {createNote} from './actions';function EmptyNote() {  console.log(createNote);  // {$$typeof: Symbol.for("react.server.reference"), $$id: 'createNote'}  <button onClick={() => createNote()} />}

For more, see the docs for [`"use server"`](/reference/rsc/use-server).

### Server Functions with Actions[](#server-functions-with-actions "Link for Server Functions with Actions ")

Server Functions can be called from Actions on the client:

    "use server";export async function updateName(name) {  if (!name) {    return {error: 'Name is required'};  }  await db.users.updateName(name);}

    "use client";import {updateName} from './actions';function UpdateName() {  const [name, setName] = useState('');  const [error, setError] = useState(null);  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  const submitAction = async () => {    startTransition(async () => {      const {error} = await updateName(name);      if (error) {        setError(error);      } else {        setName('');      }    })  }    return (    <form action={submitAction}>      <input type="text" name="name" disabled={isPending}/>      {error && <span>Failed: {error}</span>}    </form>  )}

This allows you to access the `isPending` state of the Server Function by wrapping it in an Action on the client.

For more, see the docs for [Calling a Server Function outside of `<form>`](/reference/rsc/use-server#calling-a-server-function-outside-of-form)

### Server Functions with Form Actions[](#using-server-functions-with-form-actions "Link for Server Functions with Form Actions ")

Server Functions work with the new Form features in React 19.

You can pass a Server Function to a Form to automatically submit the form to the server:

    "use client";import {updateName} from './actions';function UpdateName() {  return (    <form action={updateName}>      <input type="text" name="name" />    </form>  )}

When the Form submission succeeds, React will automatically reset the form. You can add `useActionState` to access the pending state, last response, or to support progressive enhancement.

For more, see the docs for [Server Functions in Forms](/reference/rsc/use-server#server-functions-in-forms).

### Server Functions with `useActionState`[](#server-functions-with-use-action-state "Link for this heading")

You can call Server Functions with `useActionState` for the common case where you just need access to the action pending state and last returned response:

    "use client";import {updateName} from './actions';function UpdateName() {  const [state, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(updateName, {error: null});  return (    <form action={submitAction}>      <input type="text" name="name" disabled={isPending}/>      {state.error && <span>Failed: {state.error}</span>}    </form>  );}

When using `useActionState` with Server Functions, React will also automatically replay form submissions entered before hydration finishes. This means users can interact with your app even before the app has hydrated.

For more, see the docs for [`useActionState`](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormState).

### Progressive enhancement with `useActionState`[](#progressive-enhancement-with-useactionstate "Link for this heading")

Server Functions also support progressive enhancement with the third argument of `useActionState`.

    "use client";import {updateName} from './actions';function UpdateName() {  const [, submitAction] = useActionState(updateName, null, `/name/update`);  return (    <form action={submitAction}>      ...    </form>  );}

When the permalink is provided to `useActionState`, React will redirect to the provided URL if the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads.

For more, see the docs for [`useActionState`](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormState).

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `'use client'`[](#use-client "Link for this heading")

Add `'use client'` at the top of a file to mark the module and its transitive dependencies as client code.

    'use client';import { useState } from 'react';import { formatDate } from './formatters';import Button from './button';export default function RichTextEditor({ timestamp, text }) {  const date = formatDate(timestamp);  // ...  const editButton = <Button />;  // ...}

When a file marked with `'use client'` is imported from a Server Component, [compatible bundlers](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#bleeding-edge-react-frameworks) will treat the module import as a boundary between server-run and client-run code.

As dependencies of `RichTextEditor`, `formatDate` and `Button` will also be evaluated on the client regardless of whether their modules contain a `'use client'` directive. Note that a single module may be evaluated on the server when imported from server code and on the client when imported from client code.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `'use client'` must be at the very beginning of a file, above any imports or other code (comments are OK). They must be written with single or double quotes, but not backticks.
*   When a `'use client'` module is imported from another client-rendered module, the directive has no effect.
*   When a component module contains a `'use client'` directive, any usage of that component is guaranteed to be a Client Component. However, a component can still be evaluated on the client even if it does not have a `'use client'` directive.
    *   A component usage is considered a Client Component if it is defined in module with `'use client'` directive or when it is a transitive dependency of a module that contains a `'use client'` directive. Otherwise, it is a Server Component.
*   Code that is marked for client evaluation is not limited to components. All code that is a part of the Client module sub-tree is sent to and run by the client.
*   When a server evaluated module imports values from a `'use client'` module, the values must either be a React component or [supported serializable prop values](#passing-props-from-server-to-client-components) to be passed to a Client Component. Any other use case will throw an exception.

In a React app, components are often split into separate files, or [modules](/learn/importing-and-exporting-components#exporting-and-importing-a-component).

For apps that use React Server Components, the app is server-rendered by default. `'use client'` introduces a server-client boundary in the [module dependency tree](/learn/understanding-your-ui-as-a-tree#the-module-dependency-tree), effectively creating a subtree of Client modules.

To better illustrate this, consider the following React Server Components app.

App.jsFancyText.jsInspirationGenerator.jsCopyright.jsinspirations.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import FancyText from './FancyText';
import InspirationGenerator from './InspirationGenerator';
import Copyright from './Copyright';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <\>
      <FancyText title text\="Get Inspired App" />
      <InspirationGenerator\>
        <Copyright year\={2004} />
      </InspirationGenerator\>
    </\>
  );
}

In the module dependency tree of this example app, the `'use client'` directive in `InspirationGenerator.js` marks that module and all of its transitive dependencies as Client modules. The subtree starting at `InspirationGenerator.js` is now marked as Client modules.

`'use client'` segments the module dependency tree of the React Server Components app, marking `InspirationGenerator.js` and all of its dependencies as client-rendered.

During render, the framework will server-render the root component and continue through the [render tree](/learn/understanding-your-ui-as-a-tree#the-render-tree), opting-out of evaluating any code imported from client-marked code.

The server-rendered portion of the render tree is then sent to the client. The client, with its client code downloaded, then completes rendering the rest of the tree.

The render tree for the React Server Components app. `InspirationGenerator` and its child component `FancyText` are components exported from client-marked code and considered Client Components.

We introduce the following definitions:

*   **Client Components** are components in a render tree that are rendered on the client.
*   **Server Components** are components in a render tree that are rendered on the server.

Working through the example app, `App`, `FancyText` and `Copyright` are all server-rendered and considered Server Components. As `InspirationGenerator.js` and its transitive dependencies are marked as client code, the component `InspirationGenerator` and its child component `FancyText` are Client Components.

##### Deep Dive

#### How is `FancyText` both a Server and a Client Component?[](#how-is-fancytext-both-a-server-and-a-client-component "Link for this heading")

Show Details

By the above definitions, the component `FancyText` is both a Server and Client Component, how can that be?

First, let’s clarify that the term “component” is not very precise. Here are just two ways “component” can be understood:

1.  A “component” can refer to a **component definition**. In most cases this will be a function.

    // This is a definition of a componentfunction MyComponent() {  return <p>My Component</p>}

2.  A “component” can also refer to a **component usage** of its definition.

    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';function App() {  // This is a usage of a component  return <MyComponent />;}

Often, the imprecision is not important when explaining concepts, but in this case it is.

When we talk about Server or Client Components, we are referring to component usages.

*   If the component is defined in a module with a `'use client'` directive, or the component is imported and called in a Client Component, then the component usage is a Client Component.
*   Otherwise, the component usage is a Server Component.

A render tree illustrates component usages.

Back to the question of `FancyText`, we see that the component definition does _not_ have a `'use client'` directive and it has two usages.

The usage of `FancyText` as a child of `App`, marks that usage as a Server Component. When `FancyText` is imported and called under `InspirationGenerator`, that usage of `FancyText` is a Client Component as `InspirationGenerator` contains a `'use client'` directive.

This means that the component definition for `FancyText` will both be evaluated on the server and also downloaded by the client to render its Client Component usage.

##### Deep Dive

#### Why is `Copyright` a Server Component?[](#why-is-copyright-a-server-component "Link for this heading")

Show Details

Because `Copyright` is rendered as a child of the Client Component `InspirationGenerator`, you might be surprised that it is a Server Component.

Recall that `'use client'` defines the boundary between server and client code on the _module dependency tree_, not the render tree.

`'use client'` defines the boundary between server and client code on the module dependency tree.

In the module dependency tree, we see that `App.js` imports and calls `Copyright` from the `Copyright.js` module. As `Copyright.js` does not contain a `'use client'` directive, the component usage is rendered on the server. `App` is rendered on the server as it is the root component.

Client Components can render Server Components because you can pass JSX as props. In this case, `InspirationGenerator` receives `Copyright` as [children](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children). However, the `InspirationGenerator` module never directly imports the `Copyright` module nor calls the component, all of that is done by `App`. In fact, the `Copyright` component is fully executed before `InspirationGenerator` starts rendering.

The takeaway is that a parent-child render relationship between components does not guarantee the same render environment.

### When to use `'use client'`[](#when-to-use-use-client "Link for this heading")

With `'use client'`, you can determine when components are Client Components. As Server Components are default, here is a brief overview of the advantages and limitations to Server Components to determine when you need to mark something as client rendered.

For simplicity, we talk about Server Components, but the same principles apply to all code in your app that is server run.

#### Advantages of Server Components[](#advantages "Link for Advantages of Server Components ")

*   Server Components can reduce the amount of code sent and run by the client. Only Client modules are bundled and evaluated by the client.
*   Server Components benefit from running on the server. They can access the local filesystem and may experience low latency for data fetches and network requests.

#### Limitations of Server Components[](#limitations "Link for Limitations of Server Components ")

*   Server Components cannot support interaction as event handlers must be registered and triggered by a client.
    *   For example, event handlers like `onClick` can only be defined in Client Components.
*   Server Components cannot use most Hooks.
    *   When Server Components are rendered, their output is essentially a list of components for the client to render. Server Components do not persist in memory after render and cannot have their own state.

### Serializable types returned by Server Components[](#serializable-types "Link for Serializable types returned by Server Components ")

As in any React app, parent components pass data to child components. As they are rendered in different environments, passing data from a Server Component to a Client Component requires extra consideration.

Prop values passed from a Server Component to Client Component must be serializable.

Serializable props include:

*   Primitives
    *   [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String)
    *   [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number)
    *   [bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)
    *   [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean)
    *   [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Undefined)
    *   [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null)
    *   [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol), only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via [`Symbol.for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/for)
*   Iterables containing serializable values
    *   [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
    *   [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
    *   [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
    *   [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
    *   [TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) and [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
*   [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
*   Plain [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object): those created with [object initializers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer), with serializable properties
*   Functions that are [Server Functions](/reference/rsc/server-functions)
*   Client or Server Component elements (JSX)
*   [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

Notably, these are not supported:

*   [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) that are not exported from client-marked modules or marked with [`'use server'`](/reference/rsc/use-server)
*   [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript)
*   Objects that are instances of any class (other than the built-ins mentioned) or objects with [a null prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#null-prototype_objects)
*   Symbols not registered globally, ex. `Symbol('my new symbol')`

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Building with interactivity and state[](#building-with-interactivity-and-state "Link for Building with interactivity and state ")

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter({initialValue = 0}) {
  const \[countValue, setCountValue\] = useState(initialValue);
  const increment = () \=> setCountValue(countValue + 1);
  const decrement = () \=> setCountValue(countValue - 1);
  return (
    <\>
      <h2\>Count Value: {countValue}</h2\>
      <button onClick\={increment}\>+1</button\>
      <button onClick\={decrement}\>\-1</button\>
    </\>
  );
}

Show more

As `Counter` requires both the `useState` Hook and event handlers to increment or decrement the value, this component must be a Client Component and will require a `'use client'` directive at the top.

In contrast, a component that renders UI without interaction will not need to be a Client Component.

    import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';import Counter from './Counter';export default async function CounterContainer() {  const initialValue = await readFile('/path/to/counter_value');  return <Counter initialValue={initialValue} />}

For example, `Counter`’s parent component, `CounterContainer`, does not require `'use client'` as it is not interactive and does not use state. In addition, `CounterContainer` must be a Server Component as it reads from the local file system on the server, which is possible only in a Server Component.

There are also components that don’t use any server or client-only features and can be agnostic to where they render. In our earlier example, `FancyText` is one such component.

    export default function FancyText({title, text}) {  return title    ? <h1 className='fancy title'>{text}</h1>    : <h3 className='fancy cursive'>{text}</h3>}

In this case, we don’t add the `'use client'` directive, resulting in `FancyText`’s _output_ (rather than its source code) to be sent to the browser when referenced from a Server Component. As demonstrated in the earlier Inspirations app example, `FancyText` is used as both a Server or Client Component, depending on where it is imported and used.

But if `FancyText`’s HTML output was large relative to its source code (including dependencies), it might be more efficient to force it to always be a Client Component. Components that return a long SVG path string are one case where it may be more efficient to force a component to be a Client Component.

### Using client APIs[](#using-client-apis "Link for Using client APIs ")

Your React app may use client-specific APIs, such as the browser’s APIs for web storage, audio and video manipulation, and device hardware, among [others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

In this example, the component uses [DOM APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM) to manipulate a [`canvas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element. Since those APIs are only available in the browser, it must be marked as a Client Component.

    'use client';import {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';export default function Circle() {  const ref = useRef(null);  useLayoutEffect(() => {    const canvas = ref.current;    const context = canvas.getContext('2d');    context.reset();    context.beginPath();    context.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);    context.stroke();  });  return <canvas ref={ref} />;}

### Using third-party libraries[](#using-third-party-libraries "Link for Using third-party libraries ")

Often in a React app, you’ll leverage third-party libraries to handle common UI patterns or logic.

These libraries may rely on component Hooks or client APIs. Third-party components that use any of the following React APIs must run on the client:

*   [createContext](/reference/react/createContext)
*   [`react`](/reference/react/hooks) and [`react-dom`](/reference/react-dom/hooks) Hooks, excluding [`use`](/reference/react/use) and [`useId`](/reference/react/useId)
*   [forwardRef](/reference/react/forwardRef)
*   [memo](/reference/react/memo)
*   [startTransition](/reference/react/startTransition)
*   If they use client APIs, ex. DOM insertion or native platform views

If these libraries have been updated to be compatible with React Server Components, then they will already include `'use client'` markers of their own, allowing you to use them directly from your Server Components. If a library hasn’t been updated, or if a component needs props like event handlers that can only be specified on the client, you may need to add your own Client Component file in between the third-party Client Component and your Server Component where you’d like to use it.

### React Server Components

`'use server'` is for use with [using React Server Components](/reference/rsc/server-components).

`'use server'` marks server-side functions that can be called from client-side code.

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `'use server'`[](#use-server "Link for this heading")

Add `'use server'` at the top of an async function body to mark the function as callable by the client. We call these functions [_Server Functions_](/reference/rsc/server-functions).

    async function addToCart(data) {  'use server';  // ...}

When calling a Server Function on the client, it will make a network request to the server that includes a serialized copy of any arguments passed. If the Server Function returns a value, that value will be serialized and returned to the client.

Instead of individually marking functions with `'use server'`, you can add the directive to the top of a file to mark all exports within that file as Server Functions that can be used anywhere, including imported in client code.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `'use server'` must be at the very beginning of their function or module; above any other code including imports (comments above directives are OK). They must be written with single or double quotes, not backticks.
*   `'use server'` can only be used in server-side files. The resulting Server Functions can be passed to Client Components through props. See supported [types for serialization](#serializable-parameters-and-return-values).
*   To import a Server Functions from [client code](/reference/rsc/use-client), the directive must be used on a module level.
*   Because the underlying network calls are always asynchronous, `'use server'` can only be used on async functions.
*   Always treat arguments to Server Functions as untrusted input and authorize any mutations. See [security considerations](#security).
*   Server Functions should be called in a [Transition](/reference/react/useTransition). Server Functions passed to [`<form action>`](/reference/react-dom/components/form#props) or [`formAction`](/reference/react-dom/components/input#props) will automatically be called in a transition.
*   Server Functions are designed for mutations that update server-side state; they are not recommended for data fetching. Accordingly, frameworks implementing Server Functions typically process one action at a time and do not have a way to cache the return value.

### Security considerations[](#security "Link for Security considerations ")

Arguments to Server Functions are fully client-controlled. For security, always treat them as untrusted input, and make sure to validate and escape arguments as appropriate.

In any Server Function, make sure to validate that the logged-in user is allowed to perform that action.

### Under Construction

To prevent sending sensitive data from a Server Function, there are experimental taint APIs to prevent unique values and objects from being passed to client code.

See [experimental\_taintUniqueValue](/reference/react/experimental_taintUniqueValue) and [experimental\_taintObjectReference](/reference/react/experimental_taintObjectReference).

### Serializable arguments and return values[](#serializable-parameters-and-return-values "Link for Serializable arguments and return values ")

Since client code calls the Server Function over the network, any arguments passed will need to be serializable.

Here are supported types for Server Function arguments:

*   Primitives
    *   [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String)
    *   [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number)
    *   [bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)
    *   [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean)
    *   [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Undefined)
    *   [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null)
    *   [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol), only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via [`Symbol.for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/for)
*   Iterables containing serializable values
    *   [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
    *   [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
    *   [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
    *   [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
    *   [TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) and [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
*   [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
*   [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) instances
*   Plain [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object): those created with [object initializers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer), with serializable properties
*   Functions that are Server Functions
*   [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

Notably, these are not supported:

*   React elements, or [JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
*   Functions, including component functions or any other function that is not a Server Function
*   [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript)
*   Objects that are instances of any class (other than the built-ins mentioned) or objects with [a null prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#null-prototype_objects)
*   Symbols not registered globally, ex. `Symbol('my new symbol')`
*   Events from event handlers

Supported serializable return values are the same as [serializable props](/reference/rsc/use-client#passing-props-from-server-to-client-components) for a boundary Client Component.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Server Functions in forms[](#server-functions-in-forms "Link for Server Functions in forms ")

The most common use case of Server Functions will be calling functions that mutate data. On the browser, the [HTML form element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) is the traditional approach for a user to submit a mutation. With React Server Components, React introduces first-class support for Server Functions as Actions in [forms](/reference/react-dom/components/form).

Here is a form that allows a user to request a username.

    // App.jsasync function requestUsername(formData) {  'use server';  const username = formData.get('username');  // ...}export default function App() {  return (    <form action={requestUsername}>      <input type="text" name="username" />      <button type="submit">Request</button>    </form>  );}

In this example `requestUsername` is a Server Function passed to a `<form>`. When a user submits this form, there is a network request to the server function `requestUsername`. When calling a Server Function in a form, React will supply the form’s [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) as the first argument to the Server Function.

By passing a Server Function to the form `action`, React can [progressively enhance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) the form. This means that forms can be submitted before the JavaScript bundle is loaded.

#### Handling return values in forms[](#handling-return-values "Link for Handling return values in forms ")

In the username request form, there might be the chance that a username is not available. `requestUsername` should tell us if it fails or not.

To update the UI based on the result of a Server Function while supporting progressive enhancement, use [`useActionState`](/reference/react/useActionState).

    // requestUsername.js'use server';export default async function requestUsername(formData) {  const username = formData.get('username');  if (canRequest(username)) {    // ...    return 'successful';  }  return 'failed';}

    // UsernameForm.js'use client';import { useActionState } from 'react';import requestUsername from './requestUsername';function UsernameForm() {  const [state, action] = useActionState(requestUsername, null, 'n/a');  return (    <>      <form action={action}>        <input type="text" name="username" />        <button type="submit">Request</button>      </form>      <p>Last submission request returned: {state}</p>    </>  );}

Note that like most Hooks, `useActionState` can only be called in [client code](/reference/rsc/use-client).

### Calling a Server Function outside of `<form>`[](#calling-a-server-function-outside-of-form "Link for this heading")

Server Functions are exposed server endpoints and can be called anywhere in client code.

When using a Server Function outside a [form](/reference/react-dom/components/form), call the Server Function in a [Transition](/reference/react/useTransition), which allows you to display a loading indicator, show [optimistic state updates](/reference/react/useOptimistic), and handle unexpected errors. Forms will automatically wrap Server Functions in transitions.

    import incrementLike from './actions';import { useState, useTransition } from 'react';function LikeButton() {  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();  const [likeCount, setLikeCount] = useState(0);  const onClick = () => {    startTransition(async () => {      const currentCount = await incrementLike();      setLikeCount(currentCount);    });  };  return (    <>      <p>Total Likes: {likeCount}</p>      <button onClick={onClick} disabled={isPending}>Like</button>;    </>  );}

    // actions.js'use server';let likeCount = 0;export default async function incrementLike() {  likeCount++;  return likeCount;}

To read a Server Function return value, you’ll need to `await` the promise returned.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `Children.count(children)`[](#children-count "Link for this heading")

Call `Children.count(children)` to count the number of children in the `children` data structure.

    import { Children } from 'react';function RowList({ children }) {  return (    <>      <h1>Total rows: {Children.count(children)}</h1>      ...    </>  );}

[See more examples below.](#counting-children)

#### Parameters[](#children-count-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `children`: The value of the [`children` prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) received by your component.

#### Returns[](#children-count-returns "Link for Returns ")

The number of nodes inside these `children`.

#### Caveats[](#children-count-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Empty nodes (`null`, `undefined`, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and [React elements](/reference/react/createElement) count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. **The traversal does not go deeper than React elements:** they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. [Fragments](/reference/react/Fragment) don’t get traversed.

* * *

### `Children.forEach(children, fn, thisArg?)`[](#children-foreach "Link for this heading")

Call `Children.forEach(children, fn, thisArg?)` to run some code for each child in the `children` data structure.

    import { Children } from 'react';function SeparatorList({ children }) {  const result = [];  Children.forEach(children, (child, index) => {    result.push(child);    result.push(<hr key={index} />);  });  // ...

[See more examples below.](#running-some-code-for-each-child)

#### Parameters[](#children-foreach-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `children`: The value of the [`children` prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) received by your component.
*   `fn`: The function you want to run for each child, similar to the [array `forEach` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) callback. It will be called with the child as the first argument and its index as the second argument. The index starts at `0` and increments on each call.
*   **optional** `thisArg`: The [`this` value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) with which the `fn` function should be called. If omitted, it’s `undefined`.

#### Returns[](#children-foreach-returns "Link for Returns ")

`Children.forEach` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#children-foreach-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Empty nodes (`null`, `undefined`, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and [React elements](/reference/react/createElement) count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. **The traversal does not go deeper than React elements:** they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. [Fragments](/reference/react/Fragment) don’t get traversed.

* * *

### `Children.map(children, fn, thisArg?)`[](#children-map "Link for this heading")

Call `Children.map(children, fn, thisArg?)` to map or transform each child in the `children` data structure.

    import { Children } from 'react';function RowList({ children }) {  return (    <div className="RowList">      {Children.map(children, child =>        <div className="Row">          {child}        </div>      )}    </div>  );}

[See more examples below.](#transforming-children)

#### Parameters[](#children-map-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `children`: The value of the [`children` prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) received by your component.
*   `fn`: The mapping function, similar to the [array `map` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) callback. It will be called with the child as the first argument and its index as the second argument. The index starts at `0` and increments on each call. You need to return a React node from this function. This may be an empty node (`null`, `undefined`, or a Boolean), a string, a number, a React element, or an array of other React nodes.
*   **optional** `thisArg`: The [`this` value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) with which the `fn` function should be called. If omitted, it’s `undefined`.

#### Returns[](#children-map-returns "Link for Returns ")

If `children` is `null` or `undefined`, returns the same value.

Otherwise, returns a flat array consisting of the nodes you’ve returned from the `fn` function. The returned array will contain all nodes you returned except for `null` and `undefined`.

#### Caveats[](#children-map-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Empty nodes (`null`, `undefined`, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and [React elements](/reference/react/createElement) count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. **The traversal does not go deeper than React elements:** they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. [Fragments](/reference/react/Fragment) don’t get traversed.
    
*   If you return an element or an array of elements with keys from `fn`, **the returned elements’ keys will be automatically combined with the key of the corresponding original item from `children`.** When you return multiple elements from `fn` in an array, their keys only need to be unique locally amongst each other.
    

* * *

### `Children.only(children)`[](#children-only "Link for this heading")

Call `Children.only(children)` to assert that `children` represent a single React element.

    function Box({ children }) {  const element = Children.only(children);  // ...

#### Parameters[](#children-only-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `children`: The value of the [`children` prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) received by your component.

#### Returns[](#children-only-returns "Link for Returns ")

If `children` [is a valid element,](/reference/react/isValidElement) returns that element.

Otherwise, throws an error.

#### Caveats[](#children-only-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   This method always **throws if you pass an array (such as the return value of `Children.map`) as `children`.** In other words, it enforces that `children` is a single React element, not that it’s an array with a single element.

* * *

### `Children.toArray(children)`[](#children-toarray "Link for this heading")

Call `Children.toArray(children)` to create an array out of the `children` data structure.

    import { Children } from 'react';export default function ReversedList({ children }) {  const result = Children.toArray(children);  result.reverse();  // ...

#### Parameters[](#children-toarray-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `children`: The value of the [`children` prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) received by your component.

#### Returns[](#children-toarray-returns "Link for Returns ")

Returns a flat array of elements in `children`.

#### Caveats[](#children-toarray-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Empty nodes (`null`, `undefined`, and Booleans) will be omitted in the returned array. **The returned elements’ keys will be calculated from the original elements’ keys and their level of nesting and position.** This ensures that flattening the array does not introduce changes in behavior.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Transforming children[](#transforming-children "Link for Transforming children ")

To transform the children JSX that your component [receives as the `children` prop,](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) call `Children.map`:

    import { Children } from 'react';function RowList({ children }) {  return (    <div className="RowList">      {Children.map(children, child =>        <div className="Row">          {child}        </div>      )}    </div>  );}

In the example above, the `RowList` wraps every child it receives into a `<div className="Row">` container. For example, let’s say the parent component passes three `<p>` tags as the `children` prop to `RowList`:

    <RowList>  <p>This is the first item.</p>  <p>This is the second item.</p>  <p>This is the third item.</p></RowList>

Then, with the `RowList` implementation above, the final rendered result will look like this:

    <div className="RowList">  <div className="Row">    <p>This is the first item.</p>  </div>  <div className="Row">    <p>This is the second item.</p>  </div>  <div className="Row">    <p>This is the third item.</p>  </div></div>

`Children.map` is similar to [to transforming arrays with `map()`.](/learn/rendering-lists) The difference is that the `children` data structure is considered _opaque._ This means that even if it’s sometimes an array, you should not assume it’s an array or any other particular data type. This is why you should use `Children.map` if you need to transform it.

App.jsRowList.js

RowList.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Children } from 'react';

export default function RowList({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className\="RowList"\>
      {Children.map(children, child \=>
        <div className\="Row"\>
          {child}
        </div\>
      )}
    </div\>
  );
}

##### Deep Dive

#### Why is the children prop not always an array?[](#why-is-the-children-prop-not-always-an-array "Link for Why is the children prop not always an array? ")

Show Details

In React, the `children` prop is considered an _opaque_ data structure. This means that you shouldn’t rely on how it is structured. To transform, filter, or count children, you should use the `Children` methods.

In practice, the `children` data structure is often represented as an array internally. However, if there is only a single child, then React won’t create an extra array since this would lead to unnecessary memory overhead. As long as you use the `Children` methods instead of directly introspecting the `children` prop, your code will not break even if React changes how the data structure is actually implemented.

Even when `children` is an array, `Children.map` has useful special behavior. For example, `Children.map` combines the [keys](/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key) on the returned elements with the keys on the `children` you’ve passed to it. This ensures the original JSX children don’t “lose” keys even if they get wrapped like in the example above.

### Pitfall

The `children` data structure **does not include rendered output** of the components you pass as JSX. In the example below, the `children` received by the `RowList` only contains two items rather than three:

1.  `<p>This is the first item.</p>`
2.  `<MoreRows />`

This is why only two row wrappers are generated in this example:

App.jsRowList.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import RowList from './RowList.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RowList\>
      <p\>This is the first item.</p\>
      <MoreRows />
    </RowList\>
  );
}

function MoreRows() {
  return (
    <\>
      <p\>This is the second item.</p\>
      <p\>This is the third item.</p\>
    </\>
  );
}

**There is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component** like `<MoreRows />` when manipulating `children`. This is why [it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.](#alternatives)

### Running some code for each child[](#running-some-code-for-each-child "Link for Running some code for each child ")

Call `Children.forEach` to iterate over each child in the `children` data structure. It does not return any value and is similar to the [array `forEach` method.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) You can use it to run custom logic like constructing your own array.

### Converting children to an array[](#converting-children-to-an-array "Link for Converting children to an array ")

Call `Children.toArray(children)` to turn the `children` data structure into a regular JavaScript array. This lets you manipulate the array with built-in array methods like [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), [`sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort), or [`reverse`.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse)

Alternatives[](#alternatives "Link for Alternatives ")
------------------------------------------------------

### Note

This section describes alternatives to the `Children` API (with capital `C`) that’s imported like this:

    import { Children } from 'react';

Don’t confuse it with [using the `children` prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) (lowercase `c`), which is good and encouraged.

### Exposing multiple components[](#exposing-multiple-components "Link for Exposing multiple components ")

Manipulating children with the `Children` methods often leads to fragile code. When you pass children to a component in JSX, you don’t usually expect the component to manipulate or transform the individual children.

When you can, try to avoid using the `Children` methods. For example, if you want every child of `RowList` to be wrapped in `<div className="Row">`, export a `Row` component, and manually wrap every row into it like this:

App.jsRowList.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RowList\>
      <Row\>
        <p\>This is the first item.</p\>
      </Row\>
      <Row\>
        <p\>This is the second item.</p\>
      </Row\>
      <Row\>
        <p\>This is the third item.</p\>
      </Row\>
    </RowList\>
  );
}

Show more

Unlike using `Children.map`, this approach does not wrap every child automatically. **However, this approach has a significant benefit compared to the [earlier example with `Children.map`](#transforming-children) because it works even if you keep extracting more components.** For example, it still works if you extract your own `MoreRows` component:

App.jsRowList.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RowList\>
      <Row\>
        <p\>This is the first item.</p\>
      </Row\>
      <MoreRows />
    </RowList\>
  );
}

function MoreRows() {
  return (
    <\>
      <Row\>
        <p\>This is the second item.</p\>
      </Row\>
      <Row\>
        <p\>This is the third item.</p\>
      </Row\>
    </\>
  );
}

Show more

This wouldn’t work with `Children.map` because it would “see” `<MoreRows />` as a single child (and a single row).

* * *

### Accepting an array of objects as a prop[](#accepting-an-array-of-objects-as-a-prop "Link for Accepting an array of objects as a prop ")

You can also explicitly pass an array as a prop. For example, this `RowList` accepts a `rows` array as a prop:

App.jsRowList.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RowList rows\={\[
      { id: 'first', content: <p\>This is the first item.</p\> },
      { id: 'second', content: <p\>This is the second item.</p\> },
      { id: 'third', content: <p\>This is the third item.</p\> }
    \]} />
  );
}

Since `rows` is a regular JavaScript array, the `RowList` component can use built-in array methods like [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) on it.

This pattern is especially useful when you want to be able to pass more information as structured data together with children. In the below example, the `TabSwitcher` component receives an array of objects as the `tabs` prop:

App.jsTabSwitcher.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TabSwitcher tabs\={\[
      {
        id: 'first',
        header: 'First',
        content: <p\>This is the first item.</p\>
      },
      {
        id: 'second',
        header: 'Second',
        content: <p\>This is the second item.</p\>
      },
      {
        id: 'third',
        header: 'Third',
        content: <p\>This is the third item.</p\>
      }
    \]} />
  );
}

Show more

Unlike passing the children as JSX, this approach lets you associate some extra data like `header` with each item. Because you are working with the `tabs` directly, and it is an array, you do not need the `Children` methods.

* * *

### Calling a render prop to customize rendering[](#calling-a-render-prop-to-customize-rendering "Link for Calling a render prop to customize rendering ")

Instead of producing JSX for every single item, you can also pass a function that returns JSX, and call that function when necessary. In this example, the `App` component passes a `renderContent` function to the `TabSwitcher` component. The `TabSwitcher` component calls `renderContent` only for the selected tab:

App.jsTabSwitcher.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TabSwitcher
      tabIds\={\['first', 'second', 'third'\]}
      getHeader\={tabId \=> {
        return tabId\[0\].toUpperCase() + tabId.slice(1);
      }}
      renderContent\={tabId \=> {
        return <p\>This is the {tabId} item.</p\>;
      }}
    />
  );
}

A prop like `renderContent` is called a _render prop_ because it is a prop that specifies how to render a piece of the user interface. However, there is nothing special about it: it is a regular prop which happens to be a function.

Render props are functions, so you can pass information to them. For example, this `RowList` component passes the `id` and the `index` of each row to the `renderRow` render prop, which uses `index` to highlight even rows:

App.jsRowList.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RowList
      rowIds\={\['first', 'second', 'third'\]}
      renderRow\={(id, index) \=> {
        return (
          <Row isHighlighted\={index % 2 === 0}\>
            <p\>This is the {id} item.</p\>
          </Row\> 
        );
      }}
    />
  );
}

This is another example of how parent and child components can cooperate without manipulating the children.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### I pass a custom component, but the `Children` methods don’t show its render result[](#i-pass-a-custom-component-but-the-children-methods-dont-show-its-render-result "Link for this heading")

Suppose you pass two children to `RowList` like this:

    <RowList>  <p>First item</p>  <MoreRows /></RowList>

If you do `Children.count(children)` inside `RowList`, you will get `2`. Even if `MoreRows` renders 10 different items, or if it returns `null`, `Children.count(children)` will still be `2`. From the `RowList`’s perspective, it only “sees” the JSX it has received. It does not “see” the internals of the `MoreRows` component.

The limitation makes it hard to extract a component. This is why [alternatives](#alternatives) are preferred to using `Children`.

cloneElement[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
==================================================

### Pitfall

Using `cloneElement` is uncommon and can lead to fragile code. [See common alternatives.](#alternatives)

`cloneElement` lets you create a new React element using another element as a starting point.

    const clonedElement = cloneElement(element, props, ...children)

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `cloneElement(element, props, ...children)`[](#cloneelement "Link for this heading")

Call `cloneElement` to create a React element based on the `element`, but with different `props` and `children`:

    import { cloneElement } from 'react';// ...const clonedElement = cloneElement(  <Row title="Cabbage">    Hello  </Row>,  { isHighlighted: true },  'Goodbye');console.log(clonedElement); // <Row title="Cabbage" isHighlighted={true}>Goodbye</Row>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `element`: The `element` argument must be a valid React element. For example, it could be a JSX node like `<Something />`, the result of calling [`createElement`](/reference/react/createElement), or the result of another `cloneElement` call.
    
*   `props`: The `props` argument must either be an object or `null`. If you pass `null`, the cloned element will retain all of the original `element.props`. Otherwise, for every prop in the `props` object, the returned element will “prefer” the value from `props` over the value from `element.props`. The rest of the props will be filled from the original `element.props`. If you pass `props.key` or `props.ref`, they will replace the original ones.
    
*   **optional** `...children`: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, [portals](/reference/react-dom/createPortal), empty nodes (`null`, `undefined`, `true`, and `false`), and arrays of React nodes. If you don’t pass any `...children` arguments, the original `element.props.children` will be preserved.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`cloneElement` returns a React element object with a few properties:

*   `type`: Same as `element.type`.
*   `props`: The result of shallowly merging `element.props` with the overriding `props` you have passed.
*   `ref`: The original `element.ref`, unless it was overridden by `props.ref`.
*   `key`: The original `element.key`, unless it was overridden by `props.key`.

Usually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Cloning an element **does not modify the original element.**
    
*   You should only **pass children as multiple arguments to `cloneElement` if they are all statically known,** like `cloneElement(element, null, child1, child2, child3)`. If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: `cloneElement(element, null, listItems)`. This ensures that React will [warn you about missing `key`s](/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key) for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.
    
*   `cloneElement` makes it harder to trace the data flow, so **try the [alternatives](#alternatives) instead.**

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Overriding props of an element[](#overriding-props-of-an-element "Link for Overriding props of an element ")

To override the props of some React element, pass it to `cloneElement` with the props you want to override:

    import { cloneElement } from 'react';// ...const clonedElement = cloneElement(  <Row title="Cabbage" />,  { isHighlighted: true });

Here, the resulting cloned element will be `<Row title="Cabbage" isHighlighted={true} />`.

**Let’s walk through an example to see when it’s useful.**

Imagine a `List` component that renders its [`children`](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) as a list of selectable rows with a “Next” button that changes which row is selected. The `List` component needs to render the selected `Row` differently, so it clones every `<Row>` child that it has received, and adds an extra `isHighlighted: true` or `isHighlighted: false` prop:

    export default function List({ children }) {  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);  return (    <div className="List">      {Children.map(children, (child, index) =>        cloneElement(child, {          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex         })      )}

Let’s say the original JSX received by `List` looks like this:

    <List>  <Row title="Cabbage" />  <Row title="Garlic" />  <Row title="Apple" /></List>

By cloning its children, the `List` can pass extra information to every `Row` inside. The result looks like this:

    <List>  <Row    title="Cabbage"    isHighlighted={true}   />  <Row    title="Garlic"    isHighlighted={false}   />  <Row    title="Apple"    isHighlighted={false}   /></List>

Notice how pressing “Next” updates the state of the `List`, and highlights a different row:

App.jsList.jsRow.jsdata.js

List.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Children, cloneElement, useState } from 'react';

export default function List({ children }) {
  const \[selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex\] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div className\="List"\>
      {Children.map(children, (child, index) \=>
        cloneElement(child, {
          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex 
        })
      )}
      <hr />
      <button onClick\={() \=> {
        setSelectedIndex(i \=>
          (i + 1) % Children.count(children)
        );
      }}\>
        Next
      </button\>
    </div\>
  );
}

To summarize, the `List` cloned the `<Row />` elements it received and added an extra prop to them.

### Pitfall

Cloning children makes it hard to tell how the data flows through your app. Try one of the [alternatives.](#alternatives)

* * *

Alternatives[](#alternatives "Link for Alternatives ")
------------------------------------------------------

### Passing data with a render prop[](#passing-data-with-a-render-prop "Link for Passing data with a render prop ")

Instead of using `cloneElement`, consider accepting a _render prop_ like `renderItem`. Here, `List` receives `renderItem` as a prop. `List` calls `renderItem` for every item and passes `isHighlighted` as an argument:

    export default function List({ items, renderItem }) {  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);  return (    <div className="List">      {items.map((item, index) => {        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);      })}

The `renderItem` prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a `renderItem` implementation that renders a `<Row>` with the given `isHighlighted` value:

    <List  items={products}  renderItem={(product, isHighlighted) =>    <Row      key={product.id}      title={product.title}      isHighlighted={isHighlighted}    />  }/>

The end result is the same as with `cloneElement`:

    <List>  <Row    title="Cabbage"    isHighlighted={true}   />  <Row    title="Garlic"    isHighlighted={false}   />  <Row    title="Apple"    isHighlighted={false}   /></List>

However, you can clearly trace where the `isHighlighted` value is coming from.

App.jsList.jsRow.jsdata.js

List.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function List({ items, renderItem }) {
  const \[selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex\] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div className\="List"\>
      {items.map((item, index) \=> {
        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;
        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);
      })}
      <hr />
      <button onClick\={() \=> {
        setSelectedIndex(i \=>
          (i + 1) % items.length
        );
      }}\>
        Next
      </button\>
    </div\>
  );
}

This pattern is preferred to `cloneElement` because it is more explicit.

* * *

### Passing data through context[](#passing-data-through-context "Link for Passing data through context ")

Another alternative to `cloneElement` is to [pass data through context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

For example, you can call [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext) to define a `HighlightContext`:

    export const HighlightContext = createContext(false);

Your `List` component can wrap every item it renders into a `HighlightContext` provider:

    export default function List({ items, renderItem }) {  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);  return (    <div className="List">      {items.map((item, index) => {        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;        return (          <HighlightContext.Provider key={item.id} value={isHighlighted}>            {renderItem(item)}          </HighlightContext.Provider>        );      })}

With this approach, `Row` does not need to receive an `isHighlighted` prop at all. Instead, it reads the context:

    export default function Row({ title }) {  const isHighlighted = useContext(HighlightContext);  // ...

This allows the calling component to not know or worry about passing `isHighlighted` to `<Row>`:

    <List  items={products}  renderItem={product =>    <Row title={product.title} />  }/>

Instead, `List` and `Row` coordinate the highlighting logic through context.

App.jsList.jsRow.jsHighlightContext.jsdata.js

List.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { useState } from 'react';
import { HighlightContext } from './HighlightContext.js';

export default function List({ items, renderItem }) {
  const \[selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex\] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div className\="List"\>
      {items.map((item, index) \=> {
        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;
        return (
          <HighlightContext.Provider
            key\={item.id}
            value\={isHighlighted}
          \>
            {renderItem(item)}
          </HighlightContext.Provider\>
        );
      })}
      <hr />
      <button onClick\={() \=> {
        setSelectedIndex(i \=>
          (i + 1) % items.length
        );
      }}\>
        Next
      </button\>
    </div\>
  );
}

### Extracting logic into a custom Hook[](#extracting-logic-into-a-custom-hook "Link for Extracting logic into a custom Hook ")

Another approach you can try is to extract the “non-visual” logic into your own Hook, and use the information returned by your Hook to decide what to render. For example, you could write a `useList` custom Hook like this:

    import { useState } from 'react';export default function useList(items) {  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);  function onNext() {    setSelectedIndex(i =>      (i + 1) % items.length    );  }  const selected = items[selectedIndex];  return [selected, onNext];}

Then you could use it like this:

    export default function App() {  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);  return (    <div className="List">      {products.map(product =>        <Row          key={product.id}          title={product.title}          isHighlighted={selected === product}        />      )}      <hr />      <button onClick={onNext}>        Next      </button>    </div>  );}

The data flow is explicit, but the state is inside the `useList` custom Hook that you can use from any component:

App.jsuseList.jsRow.jsdata.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import Row from './Row.js';
import useList from './useList.js';
import { products } from './data.js';

export default function App() {
  const \[selected, onNext\] = useList(products);
  return (
    <div className\="List"\>
      {products.map(product \=>
        <Row
          key\={product.id}
          title\={product.title}
          isHighlighted\={selected === product}
        />
      )}
      <hr />
      <button onClick\={onNext}\>
        Next
      </button\>
    </div\>
  );
}

This approach is particularly useful if you want to reuse this logic between different components.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `Component`[](#component "Link for this heading")

To define a React component as a class, extend the built-in `Component` class and define a [`render` method:](#render)

    import { Component } from 'react';class Greeting extends Component {  render() {    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;  }}

Only the `render` method is required, other methods are optional.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

* * *

### `context`[](#context "Link for this heading")

The [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) of a class component is available as `this.context`. It is only available if you specify _which_ context you want to receive using [`static contextType`](#static-contexttype).

A class component can only read one context at a time.

    class Button extends Component {  static contextType = ThemeContext;  render() {    const theme = this.context;    const className = 'button-' + theme;    return (      <button className={className}>        {this.props.children}      </button>    );  }}

### Note

Reading `this.context` in class components is equivalent to [`useContext`](/reference/react/useContext) in function components.

[See how to migrate.](#migrating-a-component-with-context-from-a-class-to-a-function)

* * *

### `props`[](#props "Link for this heading")

The props passed to a class component are available as `this.props`.

    class Greeting extends Component {  render() {    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;  }}<Greeting name="Taylor" />

### Note

Reading `this.props` in class components is equivalent to [declaring props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) in function components.

[See how to migrate.](#migrating-a-simple-component-from-a-class-to-a-function)

* * *

### `state`[](#state "Link for this heading")

The state of a class component is available as `this.state`. The `state` field must be an object. Do not mutate the state directly. If you wish to change the state, call `setState` with the new state.

    class Counter extends Component {  state = {    age: 42,  };  handleAgeChange = () => {    this.setState({      age: this.state.age + 1     });  };  render() {    return (      <>        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>        Increment age        </button>        <p>You are {this.state.age}.</p>      </>    );  }}

### Note

Defining `state` in class components is equivalent to calling [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) in function components.

[See how to migrate.](#migrating-a-component-with-state-from-a-class-to-a-function)

* * *

### `constructor(props)`[](#constructor "Link for this heading")

The [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor) runs before your class component _mounts_ (gets added to the screen). Typically, a constructor is only used for two purposes in React. It lets you declare state and [bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) your class methods to the class instance:

    class Counter extends Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.state = { counter: 0 };    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);  }  handleClick() {    // ...  }

If you use modern JavaScript syntax, constructors are rarely needed. Instead, you can rewrite this code above using the [public class field syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields) which is supported both by modern browsers and tools like [Babel:](https://babeljs.io/)

    class Counter extends Component {  state = { counter: 0 };  handleClick = () => {    // ...  }

A constructor should not contain any side effects or subscriptions.

#### Parameters[](#constructor-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `props`: The component’s initial props.

#### Returns[](#constructor-returns "Link for Returns ")

`constructor` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#constructor-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Do not run any side effects or subscriptions in the constructor. Instead, use [`componentDidMount`](#componentdidmount) for that.
    
*   Inside a constructor, you need to call `super(props)` before any other statement. If you don’t do that, `this.props` will be `undefined` while the constructor runs, which can be confusing and cause bugs.
    
*   Constructor is the only place where you can assign [`this.state`](#state) directly. In all other methods, you need to use [`this.setState()`](#setstate) instead. Do not call `setState` in the constructor.
    
*   When you use [server rendering,](/reference/react-dom/server) the constructor will run on the server too, followed by the [`render`](#render) method. However, lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` or `componentWillUnmount` will not run on the server.
    
*   When [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, React will call `constructor` twice in development and then throw away one of the instances. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the `constructor`.
    

### Note

There is no exact equivalent for `constructor` in function components. To declare state in a function component, call [`useState`.](/reference/react/useState) To avoid recalculating the initial state, [pass a function to `useState`.](/reference/react/useState#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state)

* * *

### `componentDidCatch(error, info)`[](#componentdidcatch "Link for this heading")

If you define `componentDidCatch`, React will call it when some child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you log that error to an error reporting service in production.

Typically, it is used together with [`static getDerivedStateFromError`](#static-getderivedstatefromerror) which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. A component with these methods is called an _error boundary._

[See an example.](#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary)

#### Parameters[](#componentdidcatch-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `error`: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to [`throw`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) any value, including strings or even `null`.
    
*   `info`: An object containing additional information about the error. Its `componentStack` field contains a stack trace with the component that threw, as well as the names and source locations of all its parent components. In production, the component names will be minified. If you set up production error reporting, you can decode the component stack using sourcemaps the same way as you would do for regular JavaScript error stacks.
    

#### Returns[](#componentdidcatch-returns "Link for Returns ")

`componentDidCatch` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#componentdidcatch-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   In the past, it was common to call `setState` inside `componentDidCatch` in order to update the UI and display the fallback error message. This is deprecated in favor of defining [`static getDerivedStateFromError`.](#static-getderivedstatefromerror)
    
*   Production and development builds of React slightly differ in the way `componentDidCatch` handles errors. In development, the errors will bubble up to `window`, which means that any `window.onerror` or `window.addEventListener('error', callback)` will intercept the errors that have been caught by `componentDidCatch`. In production, instead, the errors will not bubble up, which means any ancestor error handler will only receive errors not explicitly caught by `componentDidCatch`.
    

### Note

There is no direct equivalent for `componentDidCatch` in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single `ErrorBoundary` component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, you can use the [`react-error-boundary`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) package which does that for you.

* * *

### `componentDidMount()`[](#componentdidmount "Link for this heading")

If you define the `componentDidMount` method, React will call it when your component is added _(mounted)_ to the screen. This is a common place to start data fetching, set up subscriptions, or manipulate the DOM nodes.

If you implement `componentDidMount`, you usually need to implement other lifecycle methods to avoid bugs. For example, if `componentDidMount` reads some state or props, you also have to implement [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) to handle their changes, and [`componentWillUnmount`](#componentwillunmount) to clean up whatever `componentDidMount` was doing.

    class ChatRoom extends Component {  state = {    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'  };  componentDidMount() {    this.setupConnection();  }  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {    if (      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl    ) {      this.destroyConnection();      this.setupConnection();    }  }  componentWillUnmount() {    this.destroyConnection();  }  // ...}

[See more examples.](#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class-component)

#### Parameters[](#componentdidmount-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`componentDidMount` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#componentdidmount-returns "Link for Returns ")

`componentDidMount` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#componentdidmount-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   When [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, in development React will call `componentDidMount`, then immediately call [`componentWillUnmount`,](#componentwillunmount) and then call `componentDidMount` again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement `componentWillUnmount` or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what `componentDidMount` does.
    
*   Although you may call [`setState`](#setstate) immediately in `componentDidMount`, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the [`render`](#render) will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the [`constructor`](#constructor) instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.
    

### Note

For many use cases, defining `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` together in class components is equivalent to calling [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) is a closer match.

[See how to migrate.](#migrating-a-component-with-lifecycle-methods-from-a-class-to-a-function)

* * *

### `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot?)`[](#componentdidupdate "Link for this heading")

If you define the `componentDidUpdate` method, React will call it immediately after your component has been re-rendered with updated props or state. This method is not called for the initial render.

You can use it to manipulate the DOM after an update. This is also a common place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed). Typically, you’d use it together with [`componentDidMount`](#componentdidmount) and [`componentWillUnmount`:](#componentwillunmount)

    class ChatRoom extends Component {  state = {    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'  };  componentDidMount() {    this.setupConnection();  }  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {    if (      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl    ) {      this.destroyConnection();      this.setupConnection();    }  }  componentWillUnmount() {    this.destroyConnection();  }  // ...}

[See more examples.](#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class-component)

#### Parameters[](#componentdidupdate-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `prevProps`: Props before the update. Compare `prevProps` to [`this.props`](#props) to determine what changed.
    
*   `prevState`: State before the update. Compare `prevState` to [`this.state`](#state) to determine what changed.
    
*   `snapshot`: If you implemented [`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate), `snapshot` will contain the value you returned from that method. Otherwise, it will be `undefined`.
    

#### Returns[](#componentdidupdate-returns "Link for Returns ")

`componentDidUpdate` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#componentdidupdate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `componentDidUpdate` will not get called if [`shouldComponentUpdate`](#shouldcomponentupdate) is defined and returns `false`.
    
*   The logic inside `componentDidUpdate` should usually be wrapped in conditions comparing `this.props` with `prevProps`, and `this.state` with `prevState`. Otherwise, there’s a risk of creating infinite loops.
    
*   Although you may call [`setState`](#setstate) immediately in `componentDidUpdate`, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the [`render`](#render) will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. This pattern often causes performance issues, but it may be necessary for rare cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.
    

### Note

For many use cases, defining `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` together in class components is equivalent to calling [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) is a closer match.

* * *

### `componentWillUnmount()`[](#componentwillunmount "Link for this heading")

If you define the `componentWillUnmount` method, React will call it before your component is removed _(unmounted)_ from the screen. This is a common place to cancel data fetching or remove subscriptions.

The logic inside `componentWillUnmount` should “mirror” the logic inside [`componentDidMount`.](#componentdidmount) For example, if `componentDidMount` sets up a subscription, `componentWillUnmount` should clean up that subscription. If the cleanup logic in your `componentWillUnmount` reads some props or state, you will usually also need to implement [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) to clean up resources (such as subscriptions) corresponding to the old props and state.

    class ChatRoom extends Component {  state = {    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'  };  componentDidMount() {    this.setupConnection();  }  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {    if (      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl    ) {      this.destroyConnection();      this.setupConnection();    }  }  componentWillUnmount() {    this.destroyConnection();  }  // ...}

[See more examples.](#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class-component)

#### Parameters[](#componentwillunmount-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`componentWillUnmount` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#componentwillunmount-returns "Link for Returns ")

`componentWillUnmount` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#componentwillunmount-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   When [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, in development React will call [`componentDidMount`,](#componentdidmount) then immediately call `componentWillUnmount`, and then call `componentDidMount` again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement `componentWillUnmount` or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what `componentDidMount` does.

### Note

For many use cases, defining `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` together in class components is equivalent to calling [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) is a closer match.

### `forceUpdate(callback?)`[](#forceupdate "Link for this heading")

Forces a component to re-render.

Usually, this is not necessary. If your component’s [`render`](#render) method only reads from [`this.props`](#props), [`this.state`](#state), or [`this.context`,](#context) it will re-render automatically when you call [`setState`](#setstate) inside your component or one of its parents. However, if your component’s `render` method reads directly from an external data source, you have to tell React to update the user interface when that data source changes. That’s what `forceUpdate` lets you do.

Try to avoid all uses of `forceUpdate` and only read from `this.props` and `this.state` in `render`.

#### Parameters[](#forceupdate-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   **optional** `callback` If specified, React will call the `callback` you’ve provided after the update is committed.

#### Returns[](#forceupdate-returns "Link for Returns ")

`forceUpdate` does not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#forceupdate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   If you call `forceUpdate`, React will re-render without calling [`shouldComponentUpdate`.](#shouldcomponentupdate)

### Note

Reading an external data source and forcing class components to re-render in response to its changes with `forceUpdate` has been superseded by [`useSyncExternalStore`](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) in function components.

* * *

### `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`[](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate "Link for this heading")

If you implement `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`, React will call it immediately before React updates the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to [`componentDidUpdate`.](#componentdidupdate)

For example, you can use it in a UI like a chat thread that needs to preserve its scroll position during updates:

    class ScrollingList extends React.Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.listRef = React.createRef();  }  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {    // Are we adding new items to the list?    // Capture the scroll position so we can adjust scroll later.    if (prevProps.list.length < this.props.list.length) {      const list = this.listRef.current;      return list.scrollHeight - list.scrollTop;    }    return null;  }  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {    // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items.    // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view.    // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate)    if (snapshot !== null) {      const list = this.listRef.current;      list.scrollTop = list.scrollHeight - snapshot;    }  }  render() {    return (      <div ref={this.listRef}>{/* ...contents... */}</div>    );  }}

In the above example, it is important to read the `scrollHeight` property directly in `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`. It is not safe to read it in [`render`](#render), [`UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`](#unsafe_componentwillreceiveprops), or [`UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate`](#unsafe_componentwillupdate) because there is a potential time gap between these methods getting called and React updating the DOM.

#### Parameters[](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `prevProps`: Props before the update. Compare `prevProps` to [`this.props`](#props) to determine what changed.
    
*   `prevState`: State before the update. Compare `prevState` to [`this.state`](#state) to determine what changed.
    

#### Returns[](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate-returns "Link for Returns ")

You should return a snapshot value of any type that you’d like, or `null`. The value you returned will be passed as the third argument to [`componentDidUpdate`.](#componentdidupdate)

#### Caveats[](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` will not get called if [`shouldComponentUpdate`](#shouldcomponentupdate) is defined and returns `false`.

### Note

At the moment, there is no equivalent to `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` for function components. This use case is very uncommon, but if you have the need for it, for now you’ll have to write a class component.

* * *

### `render()`[](#render "Link for this heading")

The `render` method is the only required method in a class component.

The `render` method should specify what you want to appear on the screen, for example:

    import { Component } from 'react';class Greeting extends Component {  render() {    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;  }}

React may call `render` at any moment, so you shouldn’t assume that it runs at a particular time. Usually, the `render` method should return a piece of [JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx), but a few [other return types](#render-returns) (like strings) are supported. To calculate the returned JSX, the `render` method can read [`this.props`](#props), [`this.state`](#state), and [`this.context`](#context).

You should write the `render` method as a pure function, meaning that it should return the same result if props, state, and context are the same. It also shouldn’t contain side effects (like setting up subscriptions) or interact with the browser APIs. Side effects should happen either in event handlers or methods like [`componentDidMount`.](#componentdidmount)

#### Parameters[](#render-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`render` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#render-returns "Link for Returns ")

`render` can return any valid React node. This includes React elements such as `<div />`, strings, numbers, [portals](/reference/react-dom/createPortal), empty nodes (`null`, `undefined`, `true`, and `false`), and arrays of React nodes.

#### Caveats[](#render-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `render` should be written as a pure function of props, state, and context. It should not have side effects.
    
*   `render` will not get called if [`shouldComponentUpdate`](#shouldcomponentupdate) is defined and returns `false`.
    
*   When [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, React will call `render` twice in development and then throw away one of the results. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the `render` method.
    
*   There is no one-to-one correspondence between the `render` call and the subsequent `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` call. Some of the `render` call results may be discarded by React when it’s beneficial.
    

* * *

### `setState(nextState, callback?)`[](#setstate "Link for this heading")

Call `setState` to update the state of your React component.

    class Form extends Component {  state = {    name: 'Taylor',  };  handleNameChange = (e) => {    const newName = e.target.value;    this.setState({      name: newName    });  }  render() {    return (      <>        <input value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleNameChange} />        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.</p>      </>    );  }}

`setState` enqueues changes to the component state. It tells React that this component and its children need to re-render with the new state. This is the main way you’ll update the user interface in response to interactions.

### Pitfall

Calling `setState` **does not** change the current state in the already executing code:

    function handleClick() {  console.log(this.state.name); // "Taylor"  this.setState({    name: 'Robin'  });  console.log(this.state.name); // Still "Taylor"!}

It only affects what `this.state` will return starting from the _next_ render.

You can also pass a function to `setState`. It lets you update state based on the previous state:

      handleIncreaseAge = () => {    this.setState(prevState => {      return {        age: prevState.age + 1      };    });  }

You don’t have to do this, but it’s handy if you want to update state multiple times during the same event.

#### Parameters[](#setstate-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `nextState`: Either an object or a function.
    
    *   If you pass an object as `nextState`, it will be shallowly merged into `this.state`.
    *   If you pass a function as `nextState`, it will be treated as an _updater function_. It must be pure, should take the pending state and props as arguments, and should return the object to be shallowly merged into `this.state`. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state.
*   **optional** `callback`: If specified, React will call the `callback` you’ve provided after the update is committed.
    

#### Returns[](#setstate-returns "Link for Returns ")

`setState` does not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#setstate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   Think of `setState` as a _request_ rather than an immediate command to update the component. When multiple components update their state in response to an event, React will batch their updates and re-render them together in a single pass at the end of the event. In the rare case that you need to force a particular state update to be applied synchronously, you may wrap it in [`flushSync`,](/reference/react-dom/flushSync) but this may hurt performance.
    
*   `setState` does not update `this.state` immediately. This makes reading `this.state` right after calling `setState` a potential pitfall. Instead, use [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) or the setState `callback` argument, either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, you can pass a function to `nextState` as described above.
    

### Note

Calling `setState` in class components is similar to calling a [`set` function](/reference/react/useState#setstate) in function components.

[See how to migrate.](#migrating-a-component-with-state-from-a-class-to-a-function)

* * *

### `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext)`[](#shouldcomponentupdate "Link for this heading")

If you define `shouldComponentUpdate`, React will call it to determine whether a re-render can be skipped.

If you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare `this.props` with `nextProps` and `this.state` with `nextState` and return `false` to tell React the update can be skipped.

    class Rectangle extends Component {  state = {    isHovered: false  };  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {    if (      nextProps.position.x === this.props.position.x &&      nextProps.position.y === this.props.position.y &&      nextProps.size.width === this.props.size.width &&      nextProps.size.height === this.props.size.height &&      nextState.isHovered === this.state.isHovered    ) {      // Nothing has changed, so a re-render is unnecessary      return false;    }    return true;  }  // ...}

React calls `shouldComponentUpdate` before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to `true`. This method is not called for the initial render or when [`forceUpdate`](#forceupdate) is used.

#### Parameters[](#shouldcomponentupdate-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `nextProps`: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare `nextProps` to [`this.props`](#props) to determine what changed.
*   `nextState`: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare `nextState` to [`this.state`](#props) to determine what changed.
*   `nextContext`: The next context that the component is about to render with. Compare `nextContext` to [`this.context`](#context) to determine what changed. Only available if you specify [`static contextType`](#static-contexttype).

#### Returns[](#shouldcomponentupdate-returns "Link for Returns ")

Return `true` if you want the component to re-render. That’s the default behavior.

Return `false` to tell React that re-rendering can be skipped.

#### Caveats[](#shouldcomponentupdate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   This method _only_ exists as a performance optimization. If your component breaks without it, fix that first.
    
*   Consider using [`PureComponent`](/reference/react/PureComponent) instead of writing `shouldComponentUpdate` by hand. `PureComponent` shallowly compares props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update.
    
*   We do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using `JSON.stringify` in `shouldComponentUpdate`. It makes performance unpredictable and dependent on the data structure of every prop and state. In the best case, you risk introducing multi-second stalls to your application, and in the worst case you risk crashing it.
    
*   Returning `false` does not prevent child components from re-rendering when _their_ state changes.
    
*   Returning `false` does not _guarantee_ that the component will not re-render. React will use the return value as a hint but it may still choose to re-render your component if it makes sense to do for other reasons.
    

### Note

Optimizing class components with `shouldComponentUpdate` is similar to optimizing function components with [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) Function components also offer more granular optimization with [`useMemo`.](/reference/react/useMemo)

* * *

### `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()`[](#unsafe_componentwillmount "Link for this heading")

If you define `UNSAFE_componentWillMount`, React will call it immediately after the [`constructor`.](#constructor) It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:

*   To initialize state, declare [`state`](#state) as a class field or set `this.state` inside the [`constructor`.](#constructor)
*   If you need to run a side effect or set up a subscription, move that logic to [`componentDidMount`](#componentdidmount) instead.

[See examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html#examples)

#### Parameters[](#unsafe_componentwillmount-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`UNSAFE_componentWillMount` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#unsafe_componentwillmount-returns "Link for Returns ")

`UNSAFE_componentWillMount` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#unsafe_componentwillmount-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` will not get called if the component implements [`static getDerivedStateFromProps`](#static-getderivedstatefromprops) or [`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate)
    
*   Despite its naming, `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` does not guarantee that the component _will_ get mounted if your app uses modern React features like [`Suspense`.](/reference/react/Suspense) If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that relies on mounting (like adding a subscription) should go into [`componentDidMount`.](#componentdidmount)
    
*   `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` is the only lifecycle method that runs during [server rendering.](/reference/react-dom/server) For all practical purposes, it is identical to [`constructor`,](#constructor) so you should use the `constructor` for this type of logic instead.
    

### Note

Calling [`setState`](#setstate) inside `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` in a class component to initialize state is equivalent to passing that state as the initial state to [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) in a function component.

* * *

### `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext)`[](#unsafe_componentwillreceiveprops "Link for this heading")

If you define `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`, React will call it when the component receives new props. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:

*   If you need to **run a side effect** (for example, fetch data, run an animation, or reinitialize a subscription) in response to prop changes, move that logic to [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) instead.
*   If you need to **avoid re-computing some data only when a prop changes,** use a [memoization helper](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#what-about-memoization) instead.
*   If you need to **“reset” some state when a prop changes,** consider either making a component [fully controlled](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-controlled-component) or [fully uncontrolled with a key](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-uncontrolled-component-with-a-key) instead.
*   If you need to **“adjust” some state when a prop changes,** check whether you can compute all the necessary information from props alone during rendering. If you can’t, use [`static getDerivedStateFromProps`](/reference/react/Component#static-getderivedstatefromprops) instead.

[See examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html#updating-state-based-on-props)

#### Parameters[](#unsafe_componentwillreceiveprops-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `nextProps`: The next props that the component is about to receive from its parent component. Compare `nextProps` to [`this.props`](#props) to determine what changed.
*   `nextContext`: The next context that the component is about to receive from the closest provider. Compare `nextContext` to [`this.context`](#context) to determine what changed. Only available if you specify [`static contextType`](#static-contexttype).

#### Returns[](#unsafe_componentwillreceiveprops-returns "Link for Returns ")

`UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#unsafe_componentwillreceiveprops-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` will not get called if the component implements [`static getDerivedStateFromProps`](#static-getderivedstatefromprops) or [`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate)
    
*   Despite its naming, `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` does not guarantee that the component _will_ receive those props if your app uses modern React features like [`Suspense`.](/reference/react/Suspense) If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. By the time of the next render attempt, the props might be different. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that should run only for committed updates (like resetting a subscription) should go into [`componentDidUpdate`.](#componentdidupdate)
    
*   `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` does not mean that the component has received _different_ props than the last time. You need to compare `nextProps` and `this.props` yourself to check if something changed.
    
*   React doesn’t call `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` with initial props during mounting. It only calls this method if some of component’s props are going to be updated. For example, calling [`setState`](#setstate) doesn’t generally trigger `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` inside the same component.
    

### Note

Calling [`setState`](#setstate) inside `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` in a class component to “adjust” state is equivalent to [calling the `set` function from `useState` during rendering](/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders) in a function component.

* * *

### `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`[](#unsafe_componentwillupdate "Link for this heading")

If you define `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate`, React will call it before rendering with the new props or state. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:

*   If you need to run a side effect (for example, fetch data, run an animation, or reinitialize a subscription) in response to prop or state changes, move that logic to [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) instead.
*   If you need to read some information from the DOM (for example, to save the current scroll position) so that you can use it in [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) later, read it inside [`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate) instead.

[See examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html#examples)

#### Parameters[](#unsafe_componentwillupdate-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `nextProps`: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare `nextProps` to [`this.props`](#props) to determine what changed.
*   `nextState`: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare `nextState` to [`this.state`](#state) to determine what changed.

#### Returns[](#unsafe_componentwillupdate-returns "Link for Returns ")

`UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` should not return anything.

#### Caveats[](#unsafe_componentwillupdate-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` will not get called if [`shouldComponentUpdate`](#shouldcomponentupdate) is defined and returns `false`.
    
*   `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` will not get called if the component implements [`static getDerivedStateFromProps`](#static-getderivedstatefromprops) or [`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.](#getsnapshotbeforeupdate)
    
*   It’s not supported to call [`setState`](#setstate) (or any method that leads to `setState` being called, like dispatching a Redux action) during `componentWillUpdate`.
    
*   Despite its naming, `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` does not guarantee that the component _will_ update if your app uses modern React features like [`Suspense`.](/reference/react/Suspense) If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. By the time of the next render attempt, the props and state might be different. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that should run only for committed updates (like resetting a subscription) should go into [`componentDidUpdate`.](#componentdidupdate)
    
*   `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` does not mean that the component has received _different_ props or state than the last time. You need to compare `nextProps` with `this.props` and `nextState` with `this.state` yourself to check if something changed.
    
*   React doesn’t call `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` with initial props and state during mounting.
    

### Note

There is no direct equivalent to `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` in function components.

* * *

### `static contextType`[](#static-contexttype "Link for this heading")

If you want to read [`this.context`](#context-instance-field) from your class component, you must specify which context it needs to read. The context you specify as the `static contextType` must be a value previously created by [`createContext`.](/reference/react/createContext)

    class Button extends Component {  static contextType = ThemeContext;  render() {    const theme = this.context;    const className = 'button-' + theme;    return (      <button className={className}>        {this.props.children}      </button>    );  }}

### Note

Reading `this.context` in class components is equivalent to [`useContext`](/reference/react/useContext) in function components.

[See how to migrate.](#migrating-a-component-with-context-from-a-class-to-a-function)

* * *

### `static defaultProps`[](#static-defaultprops "Link for this heading")

You can define `static defaultProps` to set the default props for the class. They will be used for `undefined` and missing props, but not for `null` props.

For example, here is how you define that the `color` prop should default to `'blue'`:

    class Button extends Component {  static defaultProps = {    color: 'blue'  };  render() {    return <button className={this.props.color}>click me</button>;  }}

If the `color` prop is not provided or is `undefined`, it will be set by default to `'blue'`:

    <>  {/* this.props.color is "blue" */}  <Button />  {/* this.props.color is "blue" */}  <Button color={undefined} />  {/* this.props.color is null */}  <Button color={null} />  {/* this.props.color is "red" */}  <Button color="red" /></>

### Note

Defining `defaultProps` in class components is similar to using [default values](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#specifying-a-default-value-for-a-prop) in function components.

* * *

### `static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`[](#static-getderivedstatefromerror "Link for this heading")

If you define `static getDerivedStateFromError`, React will call it when a child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you display an error message instead of clearing the UI.

Typically, it is used together with [`componentDidCatch`](#componentdidcatch) which lets you send the error report to some analytics service. A component with these methods is called an _error boundary._

[See an example.](#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary)

#### Parameters[](#static-getderivedstatefromerror-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `error`: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to [`throw`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) any value, including strings or even `null`.

#### Returns[](#static-getderivedstatefromerror-returns "Link for Returns ")

`static getDerivedStateFromError` should return the state telling the component to display the error message.

#### Caveats[](#static-getderivedstatefromerror-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `static getDerivedStateFromError` should be a pure function. If you want to perform a side effect (for example, to call an analytics service), you need to also implement [`componentDidCatch`.](#componentdidcatch)

### Note

There is no direct equivalent for `static getDerivedStateFromError` in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single `ErrorBoundary` component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, use the [`react-error-boundary`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) package which does that.

* * *

### `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`[](#static-getderivedstatefromprops "Link for this heading")

If you define `static getDerivedStateFromProps`, React will call it right before calling [`render`,](#render) both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or `null` to update nothing.

This method exists for [rare use cases](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#when-to-use-derived-state) where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, this `Form` component resets the `email` state when the `userID` prop changes:

    class Form extends Component {  state = {    email: this.props.defaultEmail,    prevUserID: this.props.userID  };  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {    // Any time the current user changes,    // Reset any parts of state that are tied to that user.    // In this simple example, that's just the email.    if (props.userID !== state.prevUserID) {      return {        prevUserID: props.userID,        email: props.defaultEmail      };    }    return null;  }  // ...}

Note that this pattern requires you to keep a previous value of the prop (like `userID`) in state (like `prevUserID`).

### Pitfall

Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. [Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives:](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html)

*   If you need to **perform a side effect** (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) method instead.
*   If you want to **re-compute some data only when a prop changes,** [use a memoization helper instead.](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#what-about-memoization)
*   If you want to **“reset” some state when a prop changes,** consider either making a component [fully controlled](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-controlled-component) or [fully uncontrolled with a key](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#recommendation-fully-uncontrolled-component-with-a-key) instead.

#### Parameters[](#static-getderivedstatefromprops-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `props`: The next props that the component is about to render with.
*   `state`: The next state that the component is about to render with.

#### Returns[](#static-getderivedstatefromprops-returns "Link for Returns ")

`static getDerivedStateFromProps` return an object to update the state, or `null` to update nothing.

#### Caveats[](#static-getderivedstatefromprops-caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   This method is fired on _every_ render, regardless of the cause. This is different from [`UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`](#unsafe_cmoponentwillreceiveprops), which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local `setState`.
    
*   This method doesn’t have access to the component instance. If you’d like, you can reuse some code between `static getDerivedStateFromProps` and the other class methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside the class definition.
    

### Note

Implementing `static getDerivedStateFromProps` in a class component is equivalent to [calling the `set` function from `useState` during rendering](/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders) in a function component.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Defining a class component[](#defining-a-class-component "Link for Defining a class component ")

To define a React component as a class, extend the built-in `Component` class and define a [`render` method:](#render)

    import { Component } from 'react';class Greeting extends Component {  render() {    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;  }}

React will call your [`render`](#render) method whenever it needs to figure out what to display on the screen. Usually, you will return some [JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) from it. Your `render` method should be a [pure function:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) it should only calculate the JSX.

Similarly to [function components,](/learn/your-first-component#defining-a-component) a class component can [receive information by props](/learn/your-first-component#defining-a-component) from its parent component. However, the syntax for reading props is different. For example, if the parent component renders `<Greeting name="Taylor" />`, then you can read the `name` prop from [`this.props`](#props), like `this.props.name`:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Component } from 'react';

    return <h1\>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1\>;
  }
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <\>
      <Greeting name\="Sara" />
      <Greeting name\="Cahal" />
      <Greeting name\="Edite" />
    </\>
  );
}

Note that Hooks (functions starting with `use`, like [`useState`](/reference/react/useState)) are not supported inside class components.

### Adding lifecycle methods to a class component[](#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class-component "Link for Adding lifecycle methods to a class component ")

There are a few special methods you can define on your class.

If you define the [`componentDidMount`](#componentdidmount) method, React will call it when your component is added _(mounted)_ to the screen. React will call [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) after your component re-renders due to changed props or state. React will call [`componentWillUnmount`](#componentwillunmount) after your component has been removed _(unmounted)_ from the screen.

If you implement `componentDidMount`, you usually need to implement all three lifecycles to avoid bugs. For example, if `componentDidMount` reads some state or props, you also have to implement `componentDidUpdate` to handle their changes, and `componentWillUnmount` to clean up whatever `componentDidMount` was doing.

For example, this `ChatRoom` component keeps a chat connection synchronized with props and state:

App.jsChatRoom.jschat.js

ChatRoom.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { Component } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

export default class ChatRoom extends Component {
  state = {
    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setupConnection();
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    if (
      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||
      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl
    ) {
      this.destroyConnection();
      this.setupConnection();
    }
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.destroyConnection();
  }

  setupConnection() {
    this.connection = createConnection(
      this.state.serverUrl,
      this.props.roomId
    );
    this.connection.connect();    
  }

  destroyConnection() {
    this.connection.disconnect();
    this.connection = null;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <\>
        <label\>
          Server URL:{' '}
          <input
            value\={this.state.serverUrl}
            onChange\={e \=> {
              this.setState({
                serverUrl: e.target.value
              });
            }}
          />
        </label\>
        <h1\>Welcome to the {this.props.roomId} room!</h1\>
      </\>
    );
  }
}

Note that in development when [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, React will call `componentDidMount`, immediately call `componentWillUnmount`, and then call `componentDidMount` again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement `componentWillUnmount` or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what `componentDidMount` does.

### Pitfall

We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. [See how to migrate.](#migrating-a-component-with-lifecycle-methods-from-a-class-to-a-function)

### Catching rendering errors with an error boundary[](#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary "Link for Catching rendering errors with an error boundary ")

By default, if your application throws an error during rendering, React will remove its UI from the screen. To prevent this, you can wrap a part of your UI into an _error boundary_. An error boundary is a special component that lets you display some fallback UI instead of the part that crashed—for example, an error message.

To implement an error boundary component, you need to provide [`static getDerivedStateFromError`](#static-getderivedstatefromerror) which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. You can also optionally implement [`componentDidCatch`](#componentdidcatch) to add some extra logic, for example, to log the error to an analytics service.

With [`captureOwnerStack`](/reference/react/captureOwnerStack) you can include the Owner Stack during development.

    import * as React from 'react';class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.state = { hasError: false };  }  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.    return { hasError: true };  }  componentDidCatch(error, info) {    logErrorToMyService(      error,      // Example "componentStack":      //   in ComponentThatThrows (created by App)      //   in ErrorBoundary (created by App)      //   in div (created by App)      //   in App      info.componentStack,      // Warning: `captureOwnerStack` is not available in production.      React.captureOwnerStack(),    );  }  render() {    if (this.state.hasError) {      // You can render any custom fallback UI      return this.props.fallback;    }    return this.props.children;  }}

Then you can wrap a part of your component tree with it:

    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong</p>}>  <Profile /></ErrorBoundary>

If `Profile` or its child component throws an error, `ErrorBoundary` will “catch” that error, display a fallback UI with the error message you’ve provided, and send a production error report to your error reporting service.

You don’t need to wrap every component into a separate error boundary. When you think about the [granularity of error boundaries,](https://www.brandondail.com/posts/fault-tolerance-react) consider where it makes sense to display an error message. For example, in a messaging app, it makes sense to place an error boundary around the list of conversations. It also makes sense to place one around every individual message. However, it wouldn’t make sense to place a boundary around every avatar.

### Note

There is currently no way to write an error boundary as a function component. However, you don’t have to write the error boundary class yourself. For example, you can use [`react-error-boundary`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) instead.

### Migrating a simple component from a class to a function[](#migrating-a-simple-component-from-a-class-to-a-function "Link for Migrating a simple component from a class to a function ")

Typically, you will [define components as functions](/learn/your-first-component#defining-a-component) instead.

For example, suppose you’re converting this `Greeting` class component to a function:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

  }
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <\>
      <Greeting name\="Sara" />
      <Greeting name\="Cahal" />
      <Greeting name\="Edite" />
    </\>
  );
}

Define a function called `Greeting`. This is where you will move the body of your `render` function.

    function Greeting() {  // ... move the code from the render method here ...}

Instead of `this.props.name`, define the `name` prop [using the destructuring syntax](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) and read it directly:

    function Greeting({ name }) {  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;}

Here is a complete example:

Start by declaring a function with the necessary [state variables:](/reference/react/useState#adding-state-to-a-component)

    import { useState } from 'react';function Counter() {  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);  // ...

Next, convert the event handlers:

    function Counter() {  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);  function handleNameChange(e) {    setName(e.target.value);  }  function handleAgeChange() {    setAge(age + 1);  }  // ...

Finally, replace all references starting with `this` with the variables and functions you defined in your component. For example, replace `this.state.age` with `age`, and replace `this.handleNameChange` with `handleNameChange`.

First, verify that your [`componentWillUnmount`](#componentwillunmount) does the opposite of [`componentDidMount`.](#componentdidmount) In the above example, that’s true: it disconnects the connection that `componentDidMount` sets up. If such logic is missing, add it first.

Next, verify that your [`componentDidUpdate`](#componentdidupdate) method handles changes to any props and state you’re using in `componentDidMount`. In the above example, `componentDidMount` calls `setupConnection` which reads `this.state.serverUrl` and `this.props.roomId`. This is why `componentDidUpdate` checks whether `this.state.serverUrl` and `this.props.roomId` have changed, and resets the connection if they did. If your `componentDidUpdate` logic is missing or doesn’t handle changes to all relevant props and state, fix that first.

In the above example, the logic inside the lifecycle methods connects the component to a system outside of React (a chat server). To connect a component to an external system, [describe this logic as a single Effect:](/reference/react/useEffect#connecting-to-an-external-system)

    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => {      connection.disconnect();    };  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);  // ...}

This [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect) call is equivalent to the logic in the lifecycle methods above. If your lifecycle methods do multiple unrelated things, [split them into multiple independent Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#is-your-effect-doing-several-unrelated-things) Here is a complete example you can play with:

createElement[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===================================================

`createElement` lets you create a React element. It serves as an alternative to writing [JSX.](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)

    const element = createElement(type, props, ...children)

*   [Reference](#reference)
    *   [`createElement(type, props, ...children)`](#createelement)
*   [Usage](#usage)
    *   [Creating an element without JSX](#creating-an-element-without-jsx)

* * *

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `createElement(type, props, ...children)`[](#createelement "Link for this heading")

Call `createElement` to create a React element with the given `type`, `props`, and `children`.

    import { createElement } from 'react';function Greeting({ name }) {  return createElement(    'h1',    { className: 'greeting' },    'Hello'  );}

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `type`: The `type` argument must be a valid React component type. For example, it could be a tag name string (such as `'div'` or `'span'`), or a React component (a function, a class, or a special component like [`Fragment`](/reference/react/Fragment)).
    
*   `props`: The `props` argument must either be an object or `null`. If you pass `null`, it will be treated the same as an empty object. React will create an element with props matching the `props` you have passed. Note that `ref` and `key` from your `props` object are special and will _not_ be available as `element.props.ref` and `element.props.key` on the returned `element`. They will be available as `element.ref` and `element.key`.
    
*   **optional** `...children`: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, [portals](/reference/react-dom/createPortal), empty nodes (`null`, `undefined`, `true`, and `false`), and arrays of React nodes.
    

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`createElement` returns a React element object with a few properties:

*   `type`: The `type` you have passed.
*   `props`: The `props` you have passed except for `ref` and `key`.
*   `ref`: The `ref` you have passed. If missing, `null`.
*   `key`: The `key` you have passed, coerced to a string. If missing, `null`.

Usually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   You must **treat React elements and their props as [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)** and never change their contents after creation. In development, React will [freeze](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) the returned element and its `props` property shallowly to enforce this.
    
*   When you use JSX, **you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component.** In other words, `<Something />` is equivalent to `createElement(Something)`, but `<something />` (lowercase) is equivalent to `createElement('something')` (note it’s a string, so it will be treated as a built-in HTML tag).
    
*   You should only **pass children as multiple arguments to `createElement` if they are all statically known,** like `createElement('h1', {}, child1, child2, child3)`. If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: `createElement('ul', {}, listItems)`. This ensures that React will [warn you about missing `key`s](/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key) for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Creating an element without JSX[](#creating-an-element-without-jsx "Link for Creating an element without JSX ")

If you don’t like [JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) or can’t use it in your project, you can use `createElement` as an alternative.

To create an element without JSX, call `createElement` with some type, props, and children:

    import { createElement } from 'react';function Greeting({ name }) {  return createElement(    'h1',    { className: 'greeting' },    'Hello ',    createElement('i', null, name),    '. Welcome!'  );}

The children are optional, and you can pass as many as you need (the example above has three children). This code will display a `<h1>` header with a greeting. For comparison, here is the same example rewritten with JSX:

    function Greeting({ name }) {  return (    <h1 className="greeting">      Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome!    </h1>  );}

To render your own React component, pass a function like `Greeting` as the type instead of a string like `'h1'`:

    export default function App() {  return createElement(Greeting, { name: 'Taylor' });}

With JSX, it would look like this:

    export default function App() {  return <Greeting name="Taylor" />;}

Here is a complete example written with `createElement`:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

import { createElement } from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return createElement(
    'h1',
    { className: 'greeting' },
    'Hello ',
    createElement('i', null, name),
    '. Welcome!'
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return createElement(
    Greeting,
    { name: 'Taylor' }
  );
}

And here is the same example written using JSX:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return (

      Hello <i\>{name}</i\>. Welcome!
    </h1\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return <Greeting name\="Taylor" />;
}

Both coding styles are fine, so you can use whichever one you prefer for your project. The main benefit of using JSX compared to `createElement` is that it’s easy to see which closing tag corresponds to which opening tag.

##### Deep Dive

#### What is a React element, exactly?[](#what-is-a-react-element-exactly "Link for What is a React element, exactly? ")

Show Details

An element is a lightweight description of a piece of the user interface. For example, both `<Greeting name="Taylor" />` and `createElement(Greeting, { name: 'Taylor' })` produce an object like this:

    // Slightly simplified{  type: Greeting,  props: {    name: 'Taylor'  },  key: null,  ref: null,}

**Note that creating this object does not render the `Greeting` component or create any DOM elements.**

A React element is more like a description—an instruction for React to later render the `Greeting` component. By returning this object from your `App` component, you tell React what to do next.

Creating elements is extremely cheap so you don’t need to try to optimize or avoid it.

createRef[](#undefined "Link for this heading")
===============================================

### Pitfall

`createRef` is mostly used for [class components.](/reference/react/Component) Function components typically rely on [`useRef`](/reference/react/useRef) instead.

`createRef` creates a [ref](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) object which can contain arbitrary value.

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `createRef()`[](#createref "Link for this heading")

Call `createRef` to declare a [ref](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) inside a [class component.](/reference/react/Component)

    import { createRef, Component } from 'react';class MyComponent extends Component {  intervalRef = createRef();  inputRef = createRef();  // ...

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

`createRef` takes no parameters.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`createRef` returns an object with a single property:

*   `current`: Initially, it’s set to the `null`. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a `ref` attribute to a JSX node, React will set its `current` property.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   `createRef` always returns a _different_ object. It’s equivalent to writing `{ current: null }` yourself.
*   In a function component, you probably want [`useRef`](/reference/react/useRef) instead which always returns the same object.
*   `const ref = useRef()` is equivalent to `const [ref, _] = useState(() => createRef(null))`.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Declaring a ref in a class component[](#declaring-a-ref-in-a-class-component "Link for Declaring a ref in a class component ")

To declare a ref inside a [class component,](/reference/react/Component) call `createRef` and assign its result to a class field:

    import { Component, createRef } from 'react';class Form extends Component {  inputRef = createRef();  // ...}

If you now pass `ref={this.inputRef}` to an `<input>` in your JSX, React will populate `this.inputRef.current` with the input DOM node. For example, here is how you make a button that focuses the input:

App.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `forwardRef(render)`[](#forwardref "Link for this heading")

Call `forwardRef()` to let your component receive a ref and forward it to a child component:

    import { forwardRef } from 'react';const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {  // ...});

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `render`: The render function for your component. React calls this function with the props and `ref` that your component received from its parent. The JSX you return will be the output of your component.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns ")

`forwardRef` returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, a component returned by `forwardRef` is also able to receive a `ref` prop.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats ")

*   In Strict Mode, React will **call your render function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](/reference/react/useState#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your render function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the logic of your component. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.

* * *

### `render` function[](#render-function "Link for this heading")

`forwardRef` accepts a render function as an argument. React calls this function with `props` and `ref`:

    const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {  return (    <label>      {props.label}      <input ref={ref} />    </label>  );});

#### Parameters[](#render-parameters "Link for Parameters ")

*   `props`: The props passed by the parent component.
    
*   `ref`: The `ref` attribute passed by the parent component. The `ref` can be an object or a function. If the parent component has not passed a ref, it will be `null`. You should either pass the `ref` you receive to another component, or pass it to [`useImperativeHandle`.](/reference/react/useImperativeHandle)
    

#### Returns[](#render-returns "Link for Returns ")

`forwardRef` returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, the component returned by `forwardRef` is able to take a `ref` prop.

* * *

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Exposing a DOM node to the parent component[](#exposing-a-dom-node-to-the-parent-component "Link for Exposing a DOM node to the parent component ")

By default, each component’s DOM nodes are private. However, sometimes it’s useful to expose a DOM node to the parent—for example, to allow focusing it. To opt in, wrap your component definition into `forwardRef()`:

    import { forwardRef } from 'react';const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;  return (    <label>      {label}      <input {...otherProps} />    </label>  );});

You will receive a ref as the second argument after props. Pass it to the DOM node that you want to expose:

    import { forwardRef } from 'react';const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;  return (    <label>      {label}      <input {...otherProps} ref={ref} />    </label>  );});

This lets the parent `Form` component access the `<input>` DOM node exposed by `MyInput`:

    function Form() {  const ref = useRef(null);  function handleClick() {    ref.current.focus();  }  return (    <form>      <MyInput label="Enter your name:" ref={ref} />      <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>        Edit      </button>    </form>  );}

This `Form` component [passes a ref](/reference/react/useRef#manipulating-the-dom-with-a-ref) to `MyInput`. The `MyInput` component _forwards_ that ref to the `<input>` browser tag. As a result, the `Form` component can access that `<input>` DOM node and call [`focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) on it.

Keep in mind that exposing a ref to the DOM node inside your component makes it harder to change your component’s internals later. You will typically expose DOM nodes from reusable low-level components like buttons or text inputs, but you won’t do it for application-level components like an avatar or a comment.

#### Examples of forwarding a ref[](#examples "Link for Examples of forwarding a ref")

1. Focusing a text input 2. Playing and pausing a video

#### 

Example 1 of 2:

Focusing a text input[](#focusing-a-text-input "Link for this heading")

Clicking the button will focus the input. The `Form` component defines a ref and passes it to the `MyInput` component. The `MyInput` component forwards that ref to the browser `<input>`. This lets the `Form` component focus the `<input>`.

### Forwarding a ref through multiple components[](#forwarding-a-ref-through-multiple-components "Link for Forwarding a ref through multiple components ")

Instead of forwarding a `ref` to a DOM node, you can forward it to your own component like `MyInput`:

    const FormField = forwardRef(function FormField(props, ref) {  // ...  return (    <>      <MyInput ref={ref} />      ...    </>  );});

If that `MyInput` component forwards a ref to its `<input>`, a ref to `FormField` will give you that `<input>`:

    function Form() {  const ref = useRef(null);  function handleClick() {    ref.current.focus();  }  return (    <form>      <FormField label="Enter your name:" ref={ref} isRequired={true} />      <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>        Edit      </button>    </form>  );}

The `Form` component defines a ref and passes it to `FormField`. The `FormField` component forwards that ref to `MyInput`, which forwards it to a browser `<input>` DOM node. This is how `Form` accesses that DOM node.

### Exposing an imperative handle instead of a DOM node[](#exposing-an-imperative-handle-instead-of-a-dom-node "Link for Exposing an imperative handle instead of a DOM node ")

Instead of exposing an entire DOM node, you can expose a custom object, called an _imperative handle,_ with a more constrained set of methods. To do this, you’d need to define a separate ref to hold the DOM node:

    const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {  const inputRef = useRef(null);  // ...  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;});

Pass the `ref` you received to [`useImperativeHandle`](/reference/react/useImperativeHandle) and specify the value you want to expose to the `ref`:

    import { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {  const inputRef = useRef(null);  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {    return {      focus() {        inputRef.current.focus();      },      scrollIntoView() {        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();      },    };  }, []);  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;});

If some component gets a ref to `MyInput`, it will only receive your `{ focus, scrollIntoView }` object instead of the DOM node. This lets you limit the information you expose about your DOM node to the minimum.

App.jsMyInput.js

App.js

Reset[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

export default function Form() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current.focus();
    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:
    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;
  }

  return (
    <form\>
      <MyInput placeholder\="Enter your name" ref\={ref} />
      <button type\="button" onClick\={handleClick}\>
        Edit
      </button\>
    </form\>
  );
}

[Read more about using imperative handles.](/reference/react/useImperativeHandle)

### Pitfall

**Do not overuse refs.** You should only use refs for _imperative_ behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.

**If you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref.** For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like `{ open, close }` from a `Modal` component, it is better to take `isOpen` as a prop like `<Modal isOpen={isOpen} />`. [Effects](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.

Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### My component is wrapped in `forwardRef`, but the `ref` to it is always `null`[](#my-component-is-wrapped-in-forwardref-but-the-ref-to-it-is-always-null "Link for this heading")

This usually means that you forgot to actually use the `ref` that you received.

For example, this component doesn’t do anything with its `ref`:

    const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {  return (    <label>      {label}      <input />    </label>  );});

To fix it, pass the `ref` down to a DOM node or another component that can accept a ref:

    const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {  return (    <label>      {label}      <input ref={ref} />    </label>  );});

The `ref` to `MyInput` could also be `null` if some of the logic is conditional:

    const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {  return (    <label>      {label}      {showInput && <input ref={ref} />}    </label>  );});

If `showInput` is `false`, then the ref won’t be forwarded to any node, and a ref to `MyInput` will remain empty. This is particularly easy to miss if the condition is hidden inside another component, like `Panel` in this example:

    const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {  return (    <label>      {label}      <Panel isExpanded={showInput}>        <input ref={ref} />      </Panel>    </label>  );});

### Checking if something is a React element[](#checking-if-something-is-a-react-element "Link for Checking if something is a React element ")

Call `isValidElement` to check if some value is a _React element._

React elements are:

*   Values produced by writing a [JSX tag](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
*   Values produced by calling [`createElement`](/reference/react/createElement)

For React elements, `isValidElement` returns `true`:

    import { isValidElement, createElement } from 'react';// ✅ JSX tags are React elementsconsole.log(isValidElement(<p />)); // trueconsole.log(isValidElement(<MyComponent />)); // true// ✅ Values returned by createElement are React elementsconsole.log(isValidElement(createElement('p'))); // trueconsole.log(isValidElement(createElement(MyComponent))); // true

Any other values, such as strings, numbers, or arbitrary objects and arrays, are not React elements.

For them, `isValidElement` returns `false`:

    // ❌ These are *not* React elementsconsole.log(isValidElement(null)); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement(25)); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement('Hello')); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement({ age: 42 })); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement([<div />, <div />])); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement(MyComponent)); // false

It is very uncommon to need `isValidElement`. It’s mostly useful if you’re calling another API that _only_ accepts elements (like [`cloneElement`](/reference/react/cloneElement) does) and you want to avoid an error when your argument is not a React element.

Unless you have some very specific reason to add an `isValidElement` check, you probably don’t need it.

##### Deep Dive

#### React elements vs React nodes[](#react-elements-vs-react-nodes "Link for React elements vs React nodes ")

Show Details

When you write a component, you can return any kind of _React node_ from it:

    function MyComponent() {  // ... you can return any React node ...}

A React node can be:

*   A React element created like `<div />` or `createElement('div')`
*   A portal created with [`createPortal`](/reference/react-dom/createPortal)
*   A string
*   A number
*   `true`, `false`, `null`, or `undefined` (which are not displayed)
*   An array of other React nodes

**Note `isValidElement` checks whether the argument is a _React element,_ not whether it’s a React node.** For example, `42` is not a valid React element. However, it is a perfectly valid React node:

    function MyComponent() {  return 42; // It's ok to return a number from component}

This is why you shouldn’t use `isValidElement` as a way to check whether something can be rendered.

===================================================

### Pitfall

We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. [See how to migrate.](#alternatives)

`PureComponent` is similar to [`Component`](/reference/react/Component) but it skips re-renders for same props and state. Class components are still supported by React, but we don’t recommend using them in new code.

    class Greeting extends PureComponent {  render() {    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;  }}

Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference ")
---------------------------------------------

### `PureComponent`[](#purecomponent "Link for this heading")

To skip re-rendering a class component for same props and state, extend `PureComponent` instead of [`Component`:](/reference/react/Component)

    import { PureComponent } from 'react';class Greeting extends PureComponent {  render() {    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;  }}

`PureComponent` is a subclass of `Component` and supports [all the `Component` APIs.](/reference/react/Component#reference) Extending `PureComponent` is equivalent to defining a custom [`shouldComponentUpdate`](/reference/react/Component#shouldcomponentupdate) method that shallowly compares props and state.

[See more examples below.](#usage)

Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage ")
---------------------------------

### Skipping unnecessary re-renders for class components[](#skipping-unnecessary-re-renders-for-class-components "Link for Skipping unnecessary re-renders for class components ")

React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. As an optimization, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props and state are the same as the old props and state. [Class components](/reference/react/Component) can opt into this behavior by extending `PureComponent`:

    class Greeting extends PureComponent {  render() {    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;  }}

A React component should always have [pure rendering logic.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using `PureComponent`, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props and state haven’t changed. However, your component will still re-render if a context that it’s using changes.

In this example, notice that the `Greeting` component re-renders whenever `name` is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when `address` is changed (because it’s not passed to `Greeting` as a prop):

### Migrating from a `PureComponent` class component to a function[](#migrating-from-a-purecomponent-class-component-to-a-function "Link for this heading")

We recommend using function components instead of [class components](/reference/react/Component) in new code. If you have some existing class components using `PureComponent`, here is how you can convert them. This is the original code:

App.js

App.js

import { PureComponent, useState } from 'react';

  render() {
    console.log("Greeting was rendered at", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    return <h3\>Hello{this.props.name && ', '}{this.props.name}!</h3\>;
  }
}

export default function MyApp() {
  const \[name, setName\] = useState('');
  const \[address, setAddress\] = useState('');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Name{': '}
        <input value\={name} onChange\={e \=> setName(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <label\>
        Address{': '}
        <input value\={address} onChange\={e \=> setAddress(e.target.value)} />
      </label\>
      <Greeting name\={name} />
    </\>
  );

When you [convert this component from a class to a function,](/reference/react/Component#alternatives) wrap it in [`memo`:](/reference/react/memo)

  console.log("Greeting was rendered at", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  return <h3\>Hello{name && ', '}{name}!</h3\>;
});

export default function MyApp() {
  const \[name, setName\] = useState('');
  const \[address, setAddress\] = useState('');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Name{': '}
        <input value\={name} onChange\={e \=> setName(e.target.value)} />

      <Greeting name\={name} />
    </\>
  );

### Note

Unlike `PureComponent`, [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) does not compare the new and the old state. In function components, calling the [`set` function](/reference/react/useState#setstate) with the same state [already prevents re-renders by default,](/reference/react/memo#updating-a-memoized-component-using-state) even without `memo`.
